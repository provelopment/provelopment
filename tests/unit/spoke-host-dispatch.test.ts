/**
 * HOSTNAME DISPATCH, PROVED AGAINST THE ACCEPTED AUTHORITIES (FOUNDATION-MULTISITE-M16/M17)
 * =======================================================================================
 *
 * The build inlines ONE routing description; the request boundary turns it into a decision. These tests drive
 * that description and the boundary itself with a SYNTHETIC two-Spoke table, so the semantics the milestone
 * requires are provable without a browser:
 *
 *   claimed host                    → that Spoke's runtime segment, declared on a PRIVATE upstream header
 *   differently-cased / ported host → the SAME claim (the domain's normalization, reused)
 *   unclaimed host                  → NOTHING (fail closed, no default, no redirect)
 *   subdomain of a claimed host     → NOTHING (exact claims only — no wildcard, no suffix rule)
 *   a SPOOFED selection header      → OVERWRITTEN by the boundary's own decision (a client cannot choose)
 *   a Spoke with no canonical origin → refused LOUDLY in a multi-Spoke Installation
 *
 * M17 — WHAT THE BOUNDARY MUST NOT DO. It no longer encodes the Spoke into the pathname: the public path IS
 * the page identity, so a soft client navigation can commit. Every case below therefore asserts BOTH that the
 * right Spoke was selected AND that the boundary produced no rewrite at all.
 *
 * The normalization itself is NEVER re-implemented here: the expectations are built with `normalizeHostname`
 * and the claim derivation is the domain's `hostnameFromOrigin`.
