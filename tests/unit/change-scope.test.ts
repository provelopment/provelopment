/**
 * CHANGE-SCOPED CI ROUTING (FOUNDATION-DEPLOYMENT-ISO-B3B)
 * =======================================================
 *
 * CI no longer answers every change with the same gate: it asks who OWNS the change and runs the
 * contract that ownership requires. `scripts/ci/change-scope.mjs` is the ONE authority that decides,
 * and this suite proves its decisions — the ownership of each repository surface, the routing rule
 * over a whole change, and the property that makes the design safe:
 *
 *     unknown or ambiguous ownership NEVER yields less validation
 *
 * The assertions are about RULES, not inventory: they name representative paths from each ownership
 * surface and invariants that must hold for any input, so adding a page, a test or a deployment file
 * does not require editing this file.
