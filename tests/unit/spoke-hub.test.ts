/**
 * THE SPOKE HUB / SPOKE / HUB CONTRACT (FOUNDATION-MULTISITE-S1 / S1A)
 * =================================================================
 *
 * Four containers that are NOT each other: a Spoke Hub coordinates Spokes, a Spoke is ONE domain and
 * owns Hubs, a Hub groups Sites (modelled later), and a Site stays Foundation's existing `sites[]`
 * context.
 *
 * Hostname ownership is EXPLICIT and EXACT. A Spoke states its canonical hostname plus any exact
 * aliases, and a claim for `example.com` NEVER claims `sub.example.com` — so `sub.example.com` can
 * belong to a different Spoke, and the only ownership conflict possible is two Spokes naming the very
 * same hostname.
 *
 * The module is unwired (nothing in the application imports it); these tests are its only consumer.
