/**
 * FS-4 — canonical asset contract. Every asset configured (or defaulted) by the
 * canonical `site.assets` block must resolve to an existing static asset, and
 * the consumers must read from the resolved configuration (never hard-coded
 * paths). An adopter replaces an asset at the installation's own artwork source
 * (`content/assets/placeholders/<name>`) or points `site.assets.<key>` at their
 * own URL — both without touching components.
 *
 * S3E1C — the generated tree is NAMESPACED (the shared platform one plus the sole Spoke's), and the
 * identity roles are REPLACEABLE artwork, so they ship in the installation's OWN Spoke namespace and are
 * served from `/spokes/<segment>/assets/**` rather than from `/assets/**`. A generic-suite run selects a
 * synthetic installation and therefore cannot see another installation's Spoke namespace — correctly, by
 * S3F1 — so "this installation ships the role artwork" is asked of the installation's own SOURCES
 * (`tests/support/runtime-assets`), while "the runtime serves it" is the deployment acceptance suite's
 * subject, which runs where that installation IS the selected deployment.
