/**
 * ONE DECLARATION AUTHORITY: THE BUILD SEAM AND S3C1 AGREE BY CONSTRUCTION
 * =======================================================================
 *
 * `src/config/spoke-roots.ts` (the S3C1 configuration authority the domain/composition layer reads) and
 * `src/config/deployment-build.mjs` (the build's selection seam) must answer the SAME question — "which
 * Spokes does this Installation root declare, and where is each one authored?" — and must therefore agree
 * about every manifest: a build that selected a root the configuration/domain layer would refuse could
 * serve material the platform considers invalid.
 *
 * They are not two implementations tested for agreement: the contract lives ONCE, in
 * `src/config/spoke-declarations.mjs`, and both sides consume it (identity semantics come from the pure
 * domain, `src/core/spoke/spoke-id.mjs`). This suite proves that AT THE SEAM: for every refused case the
 * two answers must not merely both fail, they must fail with the SAME message — the strongest available
 * evidence that there is one authority rather than two that happen to match today.
 *
 * The cases cover every property of the accepted declared-Spoke/root contract: manifest shape, identity
 * semantics, locator rules, physical containment and duplicate-root refusal.
