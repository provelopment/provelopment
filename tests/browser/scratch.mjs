/**
 * THE BROWSER HARNESS'S WRITE DOMAIN (FOUNDATION-DEPLOYMENT-ISO-B3C2B)
 * ===================================================================
 *
 * This harness has TWO owners and therefore two write rules:
 *
 *   generic scenarios        run against a DISPOSABLE COPY of the committed synthetic deployment, so
 *                            their configuration edits, page fixtures and dictionary fixtures are written
 *                            into OS temp state;
 *   deployment scenarios      describe whichever deployment the build SELECTED — shipped configuration,
 *                            read-only. `matrix.mjs` hands such a scenario the shipped config path (to
 *                            READ) and starts its dev server without the override.
 *
 * The rule above used to be a convention. This module makes it mechanical: every MUTATING filesystem call
 * `matrix.mjs` makes goes through one of the wrappers below, and each wrapper refuses a target that is
 * inside the selected deployment (or the capsule directory) — or outside the two domains the harness
 * owns — BEFORE the underlying call runs. A future regression that tries to rewrite
 * `<selected deployment>/site.config.json` therefore fails LOUDLY, with the target named, and writes
 * nothing.
 *
 * READ operations are deliberately untouched: the harness reads the shipped configuration, the committed
 * fixture and the repository's own files through `node:fs` directly.
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT a permission framework: it is one guard around one process's write targets,
 * with the two domains that process legitimately owns. The corresponding architecture test
 * (`tests/architecture/write-ownership-guard.test.ts`) proves both the guard's answers and that the
 * harness routes every mutation through it.

 * WHY THE GENERATED NAMESPACES ARE A HARNESS DOMAIN. `public/assets/**` and `public/spokes/**` are GENERATED
 * output, not deployment state (`scripts/sync-runtime-assets.mjs` produces them from authored sources, and
 * both are git-ignored). A multi-Spoke proof must materialise the SECOND Spoke's own namespace, because
 * "Alpha's artwork is served on Alpha's host and REFUSED on Beta's" is only observable if Beta's host has a
 * different directory to be refused from. Only `public/spokes/**` is added — never the shared platform
 * namespace — and the scenario removes exactly the segments it created.
