/**
 * THE HUB-SCOPED SPOKE SWITCHER, PROVED IN A REAL BROWSER AGAINST FOUR SPOKES OF ONE HUB (R1)
 * =========================================================================================
 *
 * WHY THIS SCENARIO EXISTS. The unit and component suites prove the markup, the authored order, the
 * routability refusals and the no-op rule. WHAT THEY CANNOT PROVE is the thing Web-1's owner actually saw
 * missing: that a visitor, on EVERY member of a Hub, sees the switcher, can read the Hub's members in the
 * authored order, is shown which member they are on, and can travel to another member — in a browser, at
 * real viewport widths, with the real hostname dispatch answering each destination.
 *
 * ONE INSTALLATION = ONE HUB. `tests/support/four-spoke-installation.mjs` declares FOUR Spokes
 * (`primary`, `docs`, `catalog`, `support`) in ONE manifest. That declaration IS the Hub membership boundary:
 * the switcher may only offer those members, and every option's destination must route back to the member it
 * names. A hostname that belongs to no declared member is not offered at all — the routing check is the
 * enforcement mechanism, and there is no organization registry to consult.
 *
 * WHAT IS EXERCISED, and how:
 *
 *   the control, on all four Spokes      every member renders it, with exactly four options, in authored
 *                                        order, with authored labels, marking the member the request resolved to
 *   the three destination kinds          canonical → canonical (`primary` → `docs`), canonical →
 *                                        ADDITIONAL claim (`docs` → `catalog`'s staging host), and
 *                                        inspection hostname → another Hub member (`primary` → `support`)
 *   navigation                           selecting another member performs the real cross-origin navigation
 *                                        the platform composes; selecting the CURRENT member is a NO-OP
 *   the destination itself               the browser then VISITS each destination host and reads the Spoke it
 *                                        renders, so "it goes there" is a measurement, not a claim
 *   visibility                           the member with ONE Site, ONE locale, NO Locations and NO Layout
 *                                        switcher (the exact Web-1 `www` condition) AND a member that has
 *                                        other controls beside the switcher
 *   responsiveness                       at 390 / 700 / 1024 / 1280: present, usable, nothing pushed out of
 *                                        the viewport, other controls WRAPPING rather than disappearing
 *
 * HOW A CROSS-ORIGIN NAVIGATION IS PROVED LOCALLY. A Hub destination is an absolute HTTPS origin (the
 * platform refuses anything else), while this proof runs against a local HTTP dev server — so the switcher's
 * call is CAPTURED in the browser (the real handler runs; only the assignment is recorded) and the
 * destination hostname is then VISITED by the browser itself, through Chrome's test-only hostname mapping.
 * That proves both halves: the control navigates to exactly the authored origin, and that origin renders the
 * member it names.
 *
 * NO DEPLOYMENT IS MUTATED: the Installation lives in OS temp, the committed fixture is only ever read, and
 * the copy is removed when the run ends.
