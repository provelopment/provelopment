/**
 * THE REQUIRED-LOCATION POLICY, PROVED THROUGH A REAL SERVER AND A REAL BROWSER (FOUNDATION-LOC1)
 * =============================================================================================
 *
 * WHAT THIS SCENARIO EXISTS FOR. `tests/unit/location-selection.test.ts` proves the rules through the
 * public path completion and the selector's pure ordering. This scenario proves the SAME capability where
 * it crosses the two boundaries a unit test cannot reach: an HTTP request (is the public completion really
 * a redirect, and is it ONE hop?) and a browser (does the visitor SEE a Location control with no
 * unspecified option, and does using it move the URL inside the Location namespace?).
 *
 * TWO DEPLOYMENTS, ONE DIFFERENCE. The scenario materialises TWO disposable copies of the committed
 * synthetic fixture in OS temp: one whose Site declares `locationSelection: { "mode": "required",
 * "default": "north" }`, and the untouched one. Both are started, and the SAME assertions are measured on
 * each — which is what makes "an absent policy changes nothing" a measurement rather than a claim.
 *
 * NO DEPLOYMENT IS MUTATED: the copies live in OS temp (the harness's own write domain), the shipped
 * fixture is only ever read, and both copies are removed when the run ends.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP. This is a FOUNDATION contract (a platform capability, not one deployment's copy), so it lives
 * in the harness's own directory and runs in the foundation scope.
