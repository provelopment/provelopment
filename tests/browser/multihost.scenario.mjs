// THE MULTI-HOST SPOKE RUNTIME PROOF (FOUNDATION-MULTISITE-M16/M17).
//
// ONE disposable Installation declaring TWO Spokes (`tests/support/multihost-installation.mjs`) is served by
// its OWN dev server, and every request below travels the REAL public path:
//
//   HTTP request -> src/proxy.ts -> exact hostname claim -> private upstream selection header
  //   (x-foundation-spoke-segment) -> the public catch-all route -> ONE explicit SpokeRuntimeContext ->
  //   the existing M13/M14 renderer
//
// Nothing is bypassed: no request calls the composition directly, no request sets the PRIVATE SELECTION header itself, and the
// public pathname is never the internal one. The two Spokes deliberately expose the SAME logical coordinates
// (`/ww/en/about`) with DIFFERENT facts, so "same URL, different content" is proved rather than assumed.
//
// OWNERSHIP. This is a FOUNDATION contract (a platform capability, not one deployment's copy), so it lives in
// the harness's own directory and runs in the foundation scope. It writes only where the harness owns writes:
// OS temp (its Installation) and the GENERATED Spoke namespaces it materialises and then removes.
