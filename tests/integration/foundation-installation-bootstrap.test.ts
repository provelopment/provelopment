/**
 * ESTABLISHING ONE COMPLETE FOUNDATION INSTALLATION (FOUNDATION-B4B)
 * ==================================================================
 *
 * The capability proved here is the whole point of B4B: ONE autonomous Foundation installation can be
 * created, deterministically, inside a target root that is given to it explicitly — from an immutable
 * release plus authored material — and the result is complete, checkable and independent of everything it
 * was created from.
 *
 * EVERY TREE IS DISPOSABLE AND TASK-OWNED (`tests/support/installation-establishment-fixture.ts`): a
 * synthetic platform committed to a throwaway Git repository, a release the platform's own tooling
 * constructs, a seed copied from the platform's committed fixture, and empty target roots under OS temp.
 * The assertions about the SOURCE side are made by snapshotting the whole disposable workspace before and
 * after: establishment may change the TARGET and nothing else.
