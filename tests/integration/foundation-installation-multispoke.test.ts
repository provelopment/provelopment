/**
 * THE REAL TWO-SPOKE CAPSULE, ESTABLISHED (FOUNDATION-MULTISITE-M20)
 * ==================================================================
 *
 * M20's first responsibility is that establishment understands the Installation the platform actually
 * ships. Until M20 the establishment core required the authored surfaces at the Installation ROOT — the
 * legacy implicit shape — so the real `deployment/` capsule (an EXPLICIT collection declaring `foundation`
 * and `germany`) was refused by the very check that exists to accept a complete capsule.
 *
 * This is the acceptance case, not a fixture: the seed is a byte-faithful disposable copy of the REAL
 * capsule, established from an immutable synthetic release, and every assertion is made through the
 * accepted authorities — the declaration contract (`@/config/spoke-roots`, the same call the runtime index
 * makes), the configuration loader, and the content composition every page route resolves through.
 *
 * WHAT IT PROVES
 *
 *   §14  the real two-Spoke capsule is ACCEPTED, and the established target declares exactly
 *        `foundation` + `germany`, each declared root carrying its own authored surfaces
 *   §15  each Spoke's OWN configuration and page tree resolve from the target, and neither Spoke can
 *        answer for the other
 *   §16  authored material travelled BYTE-FOR-BYTE: manifest, configurations, dictionaries, pages, artwork
 *   §17  nothing outside the target was written: the seed and the release payload are unchanged
 *   §11  a seed's generated operational state is REFUSED, never silently dropped
 *   §12  a seed's own adoption record is NOT inherited; the target's baseline names the release THIS
 *        establishment wrote
 *   §37  the coupling M20 exists for: what an author can create is what establishment preserves
