/**
 * THE OPERATIONAL RECORD IS GENERATED STATE, AND PROVED SO (FOUNDATION-B4B)
 * =======================================================================
 *
 * B4B writes `operational-state.json` for the first time, and B4A's acceptance requirement is that a
 * generated operational record must NEVER become authored, version-controlled source state. That is proved
 * here mechanically, four different ways, because prose is not a proof:
 *
 *   1. the release content policy classifies the record's path as EXCLUDED — no release can carry one;
 *   2. version control IGNORES it inside an established installation, so writing or changing it cannot dirty
 *      authored state, and a health evaluation can never become a commit;
 *   3. the authored-state manifest (the same one both Vitest projects run against the real deployment) does
 *      NOT drift when the record is written;
 *   4. the record is INSTALLATION-LOCAL: the store refuses a location outside the installation root, and
 *      establishing one installation writes a record ONLY into the target it establishes — the release
 *      payload and the seed it read stay byte-identical, each carrying no record of its own. The runner's
 *      own directory is NOT an establishment source, and the contract is asserted in BOTH a source checkout
 *      and an established installation, so the answer cannot depend on ambient context (FOUNDATION-B4B-A3).
 *
 * A fifth proof lives in `tests/architecture/write-ownership-guard.test.ts`: `src/**` now contains exactly
 * two writers, this store being one, each with the ONE domain it owns.
