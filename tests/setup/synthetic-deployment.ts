/**
 * THE FOUNDATION GENERIC TEST IDENTITY (FOUNDATION-DEPLOYMENT-ISO-H2)
 * ==================================================================
 *
 * Every test in the generic tree (`tests/**`, the `foundation` Vitest project) runs for a SYNTHETIC,
 * test-owned deployment — and it does so through the ORDINARY mechanism, not through a mock:
 *
 *     the synthetic deployment is placed in CAPSULE-OVERRIDE position (`FOUNDATION_DEPLOYMENT_ROOT`)
 *     and the run therefore describes it in `@/config` (its `siteConfig`) AND in
 *     `@/config/deployment-root` (its `deploymentPaths()`), exactly as a build would for a real one.
 *
 * Why the whole identity and not just `siteConfig` (the ISO-B1C lesson): substituting only the
 * configuration left generic tests reading the REAL deployment's filesystem — `deploymentPaths()`
 * still answered with the installed deployment's paths, so a test could assert synthetic branding
 * while plant-and-read fixtures inside the shipped `content/**`. A generic contract must never depend
 * on which real deployment happens to be installed (ISO-B2B proved the cost: eleven suites broke when
 * the reference deployment moved). One selection, one authority, one identity.
 *
 * Consequence, and the point of the exercise: this project can run with NO real deployment present at
 * all — no root `site.config.json`, no `config/i18n/**`, no `content/**`, no capsule — because nothing
 * in the generic suite resolves a real one.
 *
 * The synthetic deployment itself lives in `tests/support/synthetic-deployment.ts` (config + fixture
 * tree) and is materialised into a temporary directory OWNED BY THIS TEST-FILE CONTEXT, so a generic test
 * may read and WRITE deployment-owned state without touching any committed deployment — and that context
 * REMOVES the copy when its file finishes (see the teardown below), so a run leaves nothing in OS temp.

// registered HERE — before the verification below, which may throw — so a file that fails at setup still
// gives its copy back.
//
// It replaces the `process.on("exit")` hook the copy used to rely on, which never ran: Vitest terminates
// its workers without executing exit handlers, so every generic test file left a complete deployment copy
// in OS temp (deterministic; 91 directories per full run). The removal is exact — the one root this
// context created — and never a search of OS temp.
