/**
 * ONE PAGE, TWO READINESS LAYERS (FOUNDATION-BR1)
 * ===============================================
 *
 * `document ready` and `client navigation committed` are different states, and the browser harness needs
 * both:
 *
 *   · a FULL navigation (`cdp.navigate`) reaches a new page by loading a document, so "the document
 *     finished loading and the shell's chrome is present" is the right thing to await;
 *   · a VISITOR action (a Site, Language or Location choice) navigates WITHOUT a document load, so the
 *     document-level facts are ALREADY TRUE when the transition starts and can never observe it. The only
 *     observable a transition produces is the state the next assertion reads: the resulting route, and
 *     the body that route renders.
 *
 * The historical transient this suite keeps closed: the multisite scenario dispatched a Language choice
 * and probed 400 ms later with the settle-only contract, so whenever the transition had not committed the
 * probe described the PREVIOUS page — two language-switch checks failed naming `/ca/fr/about` while the
 * third (which only required the France marker to be ABSENT) passed against that same stale page. The
 * defect is probabilistic: an unperturbed transition normally commits well inside the settle window, which
 * is why every later full run passed.
 *
 * The stubbed page below is that exact situation, so the semantics are proved WITHOUT a browser: the
 * expressions `readiness.mjs` exports are self-contained, and evaluating them against a stub is the whole
 * contract. The harness itself is asserted to have ONE readiness vocabulary and to await every Site or
 * Language choice with the route its assertion reads (the same source-level style as
 * `browser-execution-ownership.test.ts`).
