/**
 * THE FOUNDATION INSTALLATION CONTRACT'S ARCHITECTURAL BOUNDARY (FOUNDATION-B4A / B4A-A2)
 * ====================================================================================
 *
 * B4A-A2 corrected three things that no amount of prose can keep true on its own, so they are asserted
 * against the SOURCE and the TYPES:
 *
 *   1. THE SUBJECT. The lifecycle is ONE COMPLETE FOUNDATION INSTALLATION's — not a spoke's, not a Site's
 *      — and it knows nothing about any other installation. There is no clone, parent, child, sibling,
 *      source, registry, fleet or cross-installation concept anywhere in it.
 *   2. THE DEPENDENCY DIRECTION. `src/core/**` must never depend on the procedural tooling in
 *      `scripts/**`; the pure Foundation-release contract is what both sides consume.
 *   3. THE PORTS. They stay contracts (clock, operational-state store, release ACQUISITION source), no
 *      adapter implements them yet, and a release's identity carries nothing about how it was acquired.
 *
 * Import and type boundaries prove most of this cleanly; only NAMING needs a scan, and that scan reads
 * CODE (comments are stripped), because the documentation legitimately names the concepts it forbids.
