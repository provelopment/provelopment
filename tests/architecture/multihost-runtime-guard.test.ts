/**
 * THE MULTI-HOST RUNTIME GUARD (FOUNDATION-MULTISITE-M16/M17)
 * ==========================================================
 *
 * The multi-Spoke runtime is only safe while a small number of STRUCTURAL facts hold, and each of them is a
 * fact about WHERE a decision is made rather than about a value one test happened to observe:
 *
 *   · the request boundary holds NO configuration authority;
 *   · hostname dispatch is the accepted exact-claim decision, never a wildcard or a suffix rule;
 *   · no "first"/"default" Spoke can be selected anywhere;
 *   · the multi-host public boundaries never select a Spoke through the one-Spoke compatibility seam;
 *   · the PUBLIC route is the page identity, and it consumes the request-selected context and renders through
 *     the SHARED composition;
 *   · the Spoke reaches that route on a PRIVATE upstream header the boundary alone writes;
 *   · the retired `/~spoke` page tree does not exist, and nothing renders under it;
 *   · a Spoke's own asset namespace is bound to the host that owns it;
 *   · sitemap, robots and OpenGraph read the REQUEST-selected context;
 *   · the runtime index composes every declared Spoke while the compatibility seam still refuses two.
