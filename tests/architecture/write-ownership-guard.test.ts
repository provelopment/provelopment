/**
 * WHO MAY WRITE WHICH FILESYSTEM DOMAIN (FOUNDATION-DEPLOYMENT-ISO-B3C2B)
 * ======================================================================
 *
 * ISO-B3C2A answered "where may deployment state live, and who selects it". This suite answers the
 * question that follows: **who may WRITE which domain** — with two small mechanical layers rather than a
 * permission framework:
 *
 *   1. AN EXACT WRITER INVENTORY. Every executable file in `src/**`, `scripts/**`, `tests/**` and
 *      `deployment/tests/**` that performs a filesystem MUTATION is listed here by exact path, with the
 *      domain it owns and the reason. A new writer — a new script, a new test that writes, a new helper —
 *      therefore fails this suite until somebody classifies it. That is the point: not "regex proves every
 *      filesystem effect in JavaScript", but "a new writer cannot arrive silently".
 *   2. THE RUNTIME OUTCOME. `tests/setup/production-state-integrity.ts` brackets both Vitest projects with
 *      a before/after manifest of the real deployment's authored state, so a run that leaves a mutation
 *      behind fails whether or not the static inventory noticed it. The inventory classifies WHO exists;
 *      the manifest proves WHAT happened.
 *
 * The domains, in one place:
 *
 *   Foundation application code (`src/**`)                       NOTHING — no writer exists there at all
 *   deployment generator `scripts/generate-country-code-…mjs`    `<selected>/content/COUNTRY-CODES.md` only
 *   runtime asset installer `scripts/sync-runtime-assets.mjs`     `<repo>/public/assets/**` and
 *                                                                 `<repo>/public/spokes/**` only
 *   CI classifier `scripts/ci/change-scope.mjs`                  `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` (the runner's file)
 *   generic tests + the browser harness                          OS temp, the synthetic deployment, `.report/`
 *   a deployment's writable authoring test                       a disposable COPY of the selected deployment
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. Not a general ban on writing `deployment/**`: a spoke's owner — or a managed workflow
 * acting for them — MUST be able to author its own configuration, dictionaries, pages, artwork, generated
 * documents and operational state. What is forbidden is uncontrolled REPOSITORY TOOLING and TEST execution
 * using shipped production state as scratch space. It is also not a filesystem permission subsystem: one
 * guard around the browser harness's targets, one runtime manifest proof, one allowlist.
