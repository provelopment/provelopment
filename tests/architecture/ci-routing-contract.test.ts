/**
 * THE CI ROUTING CONTRACT (FOUNDATION-DEPLOYMENT-ISO-B3B)
 * ======================================================
 *
 * `scripts/ci/change-scope.mjs` owns the ownership policy; `.github/workflows/ci.yml` executes it.
 * This suite is what stops the two from drifting: every route job must run EXACTLY the contract the
 * authority declares for its scope, and the properties that make routing safe must hold in the
 * workflow itself —
 *
 *   · a deployment change runs ZERO Foundation Vitest files and ZERO Foundation browser scenarios;
 *   · a Foundation change runs its scoped suites once, never `pnpm test` AND the scoped commands;
 *   · the complete gate is still the complete gate, reached deliberately rather than by accident;
 *   · there is exactly ONE classifier invocation, in ONE job, whose whole answer is one output;
 *   · `validate` — the single required status context — always runs and fails whenever the selected
 *     route failed, so a skipped route can never be mistaken for a pass.
