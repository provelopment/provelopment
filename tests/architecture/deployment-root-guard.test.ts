 * ONE authority, and this guard is what keeps it that way: a future change may not re-introduce a
 * deployment-owned path — or a bare `process.cwd()` — anywhere else in `src/**`.
 *
 * It is deliberately NARROW: it checks a short list of deployment-OWNED location literals (the
 * config file, the dictionary directory, the two authoring roots, the asset directories) and the
 * `process.cwd()` anchor itself. Platform concerns, comments and the authority's own file are not
 * policed.

 * (`next.config.ts`), the test run (`vitest.config.mts`) and the Foundation's Node tooling
