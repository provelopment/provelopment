/**
 * A DISPOSABLE COPY OF THE SELECTED DEPLOYMENT (FOUNDATION-DEPLOYMENT-ISO-B3C2B)
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * An AUTHORING experiment — planting a page, adding a dictionary, editing a configuration — must have
 * somewhere to write, and a deployment's shipped config, dictionaries, pages and artwork are not it.
 * This is the one way a deployment-scope test gets writable deployment state:
 *
 *     copy the deployment the AUTHORITY selected into OS temp, then SELECT THE COPY through the
 *     authority's own test-only override (`FOUNDATION_DEPLOYMENT_ROOT` + the `override` layout).
 *
 * No second path seam is invented: the copy is selected exactly the way `tests/setup/synthetic-deployment.ts`
 * selects the synthetic deployment (ISO-H2), so `@/config` and `@/config/deployment-root` describe the copy
 * — and because the copy is byte-identical, an acceptance assertion made against it means what it says
 * about the real deployment (the fidelity check below refuses a copy that is not).
 *
 * CALL IT BEFORE IMPORTING ANYTHING THAT READS THE CONFIG SURFACE. `@/config` and `@/config/deployment-root`
 * read the selection at module load and cache it, so a test file that already imported them (or whose setup
 * file did) must `vi.resetModules()` and DYNAMICALLY import the app modules afterwards — see
 * `deployment/tests/integration/page-authoring.test.ts`, which does exactly that.
 *
 * It lives in the Foundation's own test support (`tests/support/**`) rather than inside the deployment: the
 * copy mechanism is platform test infrastructure, not deployment content, and both trees may use it.
