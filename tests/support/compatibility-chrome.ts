/**
 * THE COMPATIBILITY SPOKE FACTS, FOR TESTS (FOUNDATION-MULTISITE-M13)
 * ====================================================================
 *
 * Before M13 the chrome components read the module-global Spoke authority (`@/config`'s `siteConfig`,
 * `@/config/i18n`'s `getDictionary`, `@/config/assets`' compatibility resolver). They now take those facts
 * as INPUTS, so a test that is not about multi-Spoke behaviour asks the SAME compatibility bindings for
 * them instead of letting a component reach for a global. That keeps every existing rendering expectation
 * meaningful (the values are identical to what the component used to read) while making the boundary
 * explicit — and it is exactly the shape `server-composition` uses for a real context.
 *
 * A test that IS about context isolation passes an explicit `SpokeRuntimeContext` instead (see
 * `tests/unit/server-composition-context.test.ts`).
