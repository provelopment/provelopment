/**
 * DISPOSABLE PLATFORMS, RELEASES, SEEDS AND TARGETS (FOUNDATION-B4B)
 * =================================================================
 *
 * Everything establishment's tests need, and nothing anybody's real state: a synthetic platform committed
 * into a throwaway Git repository, a release CONSTRUCTED from it by the platform's own release tooling, an
 * authored seed assembled by copying the platform's own committed synthetic deployment fixture, and empty
 * target workspaces. Every tree is created under OS temp and removed by exact ownership after each test.
 *
 * THE SYNTHETIC PLATFORM IS NOT A FAKE BUSINESS. It contains the anchors the release policy requires and the
 * two modules the manifest derives compatibility from, so release construction really constructs — the
 * mechanism under test is the platform's own, never a stand-in. Authored material comes from the fixture a
 * generic Foundation contract already uses, so proving establishment needs no invented site.
