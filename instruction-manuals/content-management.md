# Content Management — business content ownership

> **Manual system:** Provelopment Foundation Instruction Manuals
> **Manual revision:** `2026-10-04.2`
> **Content model described:** the **Foundation installation model** — one immutable Foundation release (`provelopment-foundation-vYYYYMMDD.HHMM`; the grandfathered first release is `v2026.09.30-foundation-release-initial`) established into one autonomous **Foundation installation** that owns its own authored capsule, its own adoption record (`deployment/foundation-baseline.json`) and its own generated operational state, and serves its own **spokes**, each with **Site** contexts — together with the delivered authoring model those installations serve: two page modes (safe Markdown and declarative JSON), the page title as a page's only level-1 heading, and pages addressed per site and language. It also states the lifecycle contract: **Update** = authored pages and/or assets change while the Foundation release does not; **Upgrade** = a different immutable Foundation release is adopted, Installation-wide; one Installation therefore runs one Foundation release
> **Procedure validation:** the procedures were last exercised end to end on 2026-09-30 against the public Foundation product at `3698c318779d9695f98edc803854a5af6bb01b5f`: the repository gate, a deterministic release construction (`provelopment-foundation-v20990101.0000`, 368 files, digest `sha256:c29845a3…`), a disposable establishment from the real `deployment/` capsule, and the installation-owned gate. At the 2026-09-30 procedure-validation run, the only immutable Foundation release then published was `v2026.09.30-foundation-release-initial`; later immutable Foundation releases have been published since, and this set does not enumerate them because that inventory changes with every release. **No procedure-validation run was performed for revision `2026-10-04.2`**: it corrects the procedure-validation statement so it is historically scoped rather than a present-tense release inventory, and executes no procedure. No release tag is claimed.
> **Adopter baseline:** the installation's own adoption record — `deployment/foundation-baseline.json` inside the installation's capsule. An adopter's own governance record is the adopter's; it is never the Foundation's adoption record.
> **Master authority:** maintained in the Provelopment governance repository (private; not part of this product)
>
> This copy is **distributed** and byte-identical to the master revision above — SHA-256
> verified at propagation — and is never edited in place: edit the master upstream and
> propagate.

## Ownership

> **Actual business content is adopter-owned.** The platform supplies structure,
> validation and rendering; it never supplies a business's words or pictures.

An ordinary change you make to your own content is an **Update**: the pages and/or assets change, the
Foundation **release does not**. Editing a page is never a Foundation **Upgrade** — that adopts a
different immutable release for the whole Installation (`foundation-upgrade.md`). No page edit can
move the platform, and none of the procedures in this manual changes a release.

Placing platform material must never overwrite adopter content. In an installation,
establishment copies your authored material verbatim and never overwrites or deletes, and a
newer release is obtained as an immutable payload rather than copied over a project's tree.
If your own tooling would overwrite it, that is that tooling's defect (see `troubleshooting.md`).

## Where website content lives

Everything an author writes or uploads lives in **one content area**:

```text
content/
├── pages/               ← every page of the website
│   ├── markdown/        ←   the simple mode: ordinary text files
│   │   └── <site>/<language>/<page>.md
│   └── json/            ←   the advanced mode: structured, declarative data
│       └── <site>/<language>/<page>.json
└── assets/              ← the artwork the site shows: logo, favicon, images, icons
                            (shared by every site; see branding-and-assets.md)
```

> **If authored content has its own URL, it is a page.**

A page is not registered anywhere, listed anywhere or switched on by a flag: it exists
because its file exists, and it appears in the site's sitemap as soon as it is committed
and pushed.

Content that only ever appears **inside** another page — a customer quote, a card, a
statistics row, an FAQ row — has no URL of its own, so it is written *in* that page.

### Folders are the address

A page's URL is built from the folders it is authored in, and the folders *are* the
model — **authoring mode → site → language → page**:

```text
content/pages/markdown/ca/en/about.md      →  /ca/en/about
content/pages/markdown/ca/fr/about.md      →  /ca/fr/about
content/pages/markdown/fr/fr/about.md      →  /fr/fr/about
```

A page's identity is **site + locale path key + route path**, so the same page name in two
sites is two different pages. A section is a folder, a listing is a page, and the items are
pages inside that folder. Folders may be up to four deep, and every folder and file name
follows the same rule as a page name (lowercase words joined by hyphens), so a URL is always
readable and always predictable.

```text
content/pages/markdown/ca/en/services.md                →  /ca/en/services
content/pages/markdown/ca/en/services/web-design.md     →  /ca/en/services/web-design
content/pages/markdown/ca/en/legal/privacy.md           →  /ca/en/legal/privacy
```

Another language mirrors the structure exactly, so a translated section keeps the same page
names under its own language — and **every site owns its own tree**:

```text
content/pages/markdown/ca/en/services/web-design.md     →  /ca/en/services/web-design
content/pages/markdown/ca/fr/services/web-design.md     →  /ca/fr/services/web-design
content/pages/markdown/fr/fr/services/web-design.md     →  /fr/fr/services/web-design
```

An **empty language folder publishes nothing** — it prepares a language and creates no
route; and a page with no translation in the visitor's language falls back to **that site's**
default language rather than erroring. Fallback never crosses sites.

### Sites: one independent page tree each

A **site** is an independent country/global context with its **own page tree, its own
languages and its own page-facing configuration** (see `site-customization.md`, *Per-site configuration*). A site folder name is a **recognized
lowercase two-letter country code** (`ca`, `fr`, `ch`, `de`, …). Foundation validates it, and
arbitrary names such as `main`, `canada` or `my-office` are **not** valid site codes.

| Site folder | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| a country code (`ca`, `fr`, `ch`, …) | that country's site |
| `ww` | **Worldwide / Global** — Foundation-defined, and **not** an ISO country code |

The maintained, validated list of every country code ships with the product:
`content/COUNTRY-CODES.md`. Use that file as the reference — this manual states the concept
and the examples, it does not keep a second list.

> **A missing page in one site is NEVER satisfied from another site**, merely because the
> language or the route matches. Canada French and France French are different websites:
> each answers only from its own tree, so one country can never publish another's page.

### Sites and locations are different things

```text
an independent page tree                        →  another SITE
the same page tree, another office/city/region  →  another LOCATION
```

Canada and France may be independent **sites**; **Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver are
locations inside one of them**. Another physical office is not a reason to create a site: a
site is for a genuinely separate website with its own pages, and a location changes context
*inside* one site.


### Which page answers a request

Inside one site — and only inside it — the answer is decided in this order:

1. the **exact-language JSON** page;
2. the **exact-language Markdown** page;
3. the **site default-language JSON** page, when that site's configured fallback permits;
4. the **site default-language Markdown** page;
5. **not found** — the site's own 404 page.

Two rules never bend: **JSON wins over Markdown** for the same language and route, and an
**exact language wins over the site default**. Fallback is bounded to the site, so steps 3
and 4 can only ever read that site's own default language.

### The four independent visitor dimensions

| Dimension | What it selects | Changes the site? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Site** | an independent country/global page and configuration context | yes — a different website |
| **Language** | the locale **inside** the current site | no |
| **Location** | a physical/regional context inside the site (office, city, region) | no |
| **Layout** | Sidebar or Menu-bar presentation | no — presentation only |

The four are independent: changing language never changes site, and changing location or
layout never changes which pages exist. A control a deployment does not need simply **does
not appear** — a single-language, single-location site shows no language or location
control at all.

### Authoring modes — simple and advanced

Foundation ships exactly **two** page-authoring modes, and both live under
`content/pages/`:

| Mode | For | A page goes in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Markdown** — the simple mode | an ordinary, non-technical author; no programming knowledge is needed | `content/pages/markdown/<site>/<language>/<page>.md` |
| **JSON** — the advanced, declarative mode | an advanced author or developer who needs page composition Markdown cannot express | `content/pages/json/<site>/<language>/<page>.json` |

- **Markdown is a complete, ordinary authoring mode.** It supports headings, paragraphs,
  bold and italic, bullet and numbered lists, quotations, links, images, **tables**,
  code and **heading fragment links** (`# Opening hours` gains `#opening-hours`, so an
  author can build a table of contents). Raw HTML you type is shown as text, and an
  unsafe link keeps its words but loses its destination — deliberate safety, not a
  missing feature.
- **The page title is the page's only level-1 heading.** Headings you write inside a page are
  placed underneath it automatically, so `#` is still how you write a section: you never have
  to start at `##`, and no heading is removed or turned into plain text.

The page title — `title:` in the frontmatter, or else your page's first `#` heading, or else
readable words from the file name — is the only main heading, and every heading you write
sits below it:

| You write in Markdown | It is rendered as |
| --- | --- |
| `# Services` | level 2 (`<h2>`) |
| `## Website design` | level 3 (`<h3>`) |
| `### Card layouts` | level 4 (`<h4>`) |
| `#### Details` | level 5 (`<h5>`) |
| `##### Fine print` | level 6 (`<h6>`) |
| `###### Footnotes` | level 6 (`<h6>` — the deepest heading HTML has) |

A fragment link such as `[hours](#opening-hours)` keeps working, because the address is made
from the heading's words and not from its level.
- **JSON is declarative data, never a program.** No scripts, no expressions, no imports,
  no JSX, no component names, no event handlers and no raw HTML; its power comes from a
  **validated vocabulary** of page-building sections the platform itself renders. That
  vocabulary is **delivered** — see *The advanced mode: the delivered JSON vocabulary*
  below, and `content/pages/json/README.md` for every field.

A JSON page takes precedence over a Markdown page for the same language and route, and both
modes resolve in the same order — the requested language first, then **that site's** default
language. The full order is stated under *Which page answers a request* above, and a site
never reads another site's tree.

### The advanced mode: the delivered JSON vocabulary

A JSON page is **one JSON object per page**: an envelope plus an ordered list of sections.
One file describes one page.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "title": "Opening hours",
  "description": "When we are open, including public holidays.",
  "sections": [
    { "type": "prose", "body": "We are open **Monday to Friday**, 9:00–17:00." }
  ]
}
```

- **`schemaVersion`** is required and names the format version the file is written
  against (currently `1`). An unsupported number is refused rather than half-understood.
- **`title`** is required. It is the page's identity, its metadata title **and the only
  level-1 heading on the page**.
- **`description`** is optional; without one, the site's own configured description
  applies.
- **`sections`** is required, ordered, may be empty (a title-only page), and is bounded
  (40 sections).

**The delivered section vocabulary.** A section is an object with a `type` and only the
properties that type declares:

| Section `type` | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `hero` | the page's opening statement (eyebrow, lede, actions) |
| `prose` | a block of text |
| `media` | one image, optionally beside text |
| `gallery` | a grid of captioned images |
| `actions` | a group of links |
| `callout` | a note the reader should not miss |
| `cards` | a grid of cards (listings: services, work, articles) |
| `features` | a grid of titled points (what we do, why us) |
| `columns` | two or three side-by-side blocks |
| `steps` | an ordered sequence |
| `stats` | a few figures with labels |
| `quote` | a quotation with attribution |
| `table` | tabular data with column headings |
| `faq` | an expandable question-and-answer group |
| `list` | labels, optionally with detail and a link |
| `divider` | a horizontal break |

**Presentation is a finite vocabulary too.** A section chooses from a small set of named
options — surface, text alignment, items per row, media position, column ratio, ordered
list, action variant, callout tone — each a fixed value from the Foundation design
system. A JSON page cannot carry a class name, a colour, a pixel value or a style.

**Strict by design.** An undeclared section type, property or option is refused, naming
the file and the property path (`sections[2].items[0].title`); malformed JSON, an
unsupported `schemaVersion` and an unknown `type` are reported as distinct problems.
Nothing is silently ignored, and because **JSON wins over Markdown for the same
locale+route**, a broken JSON file is never quietly skipped in favour of the Markdown
one.

**Where a JSON page goes, and how it is addressed.** `content/pages/json/<site>/<language>/<route-path>.json`,
with the same rules as the Markdown mode: the file name and the folders become the URL
(folders up to four deep), another language mirrors the structure exactly, an empty
language folder publishes nothing, and a missing translation falls back to **that site's**
default language. A JSON page works at a **flat** route (`ca/en/services.json` →
`/ca/en/services`) and at a **nested** one (`ca/en/services/web-design.json` →
`/ca/en/services/web-design`) — folders are the address, in both modes.

**Safety: the same policy as Markdown, never a second weaker renderer.** Every
human-readable field is Markdown and goes through the **same safe Markdown path** as the
simple mode — raw HTML is inert text, unsafe destinations fail closed, and a heading
written inside a Markdown field is a section-level heading. An action is a label plus
**exactly one** destination: a same-site path, an in-page fragment, `https:`/`http:`,
`mailto:` or `tel:` — or a `route` naming **another page of this site** by its route path
with no language prefix (`"route": "services"` becomes `/ca/en/services`, and `/ca/de/services`
for a German visitor), which is validated so a typo cannot produce a dead link. There is
no `target`, no handler and no behaviour: a link is a link.

**Accessibility is structural, not remembered.** A document cannot choose a heading
level, so the outline is always predictable: the page `title` is the one `<h1>`, section
headings are level 2 and item titles level 3. An image either carries `alt` text or
declares itself decorative — the two are mutually exclusive, so an unnamed content image
cannot be published. Every action requires a label (its accessible name), every table
requires column headings and each row must fill them exactly, and FAQ answers are
required. A table renders as real tabular markup with column headings, so a screen reader
announces each cell with its column.

**What the mode deliberately cannot do:** no scripts, expressions, imports, JSX, `eval`,
event handlers or component names; no raw HTML or Markdown escape hatch; no styling
(class names, CSS, pixel values, `style`); no unbounded nesting (a section has items,
never sections inside sections); and no publishing metadata beyond the title and summary —
article dates, feeds and draft states are a separate capability that does not exist yet.

> **The field-by-field guide ships with the product.** `content/pages/json/README.md`
> documents every section type, every property, every presentation option, the bounds and
> the exact error messages. This manual states **the capability, the safety model and the
> accessibility contract**; that file is the author's reference — do not duplicate it.

### There is no collection store

Foundation used to ship separate author-facing **collections** —
`content/offerings/`, `content/portfolio/`, `content/testimonials/`, `content/posts/` and
`content/legal/` — each with its own directory, parser, route and feature flag.
`FOUNDATION-PAGES-A1E` removed them, and there are no adopters that need compatibility:
one authoring model is far easier to learn than five, and nothing was lost that a page
cannot express. **If you are following an older copy of this manual or an older
repository, those paths no longer exist** — author that material as pages under
`content/pages/`.

- **Offerings, portfolio projects and case studies, articles and testimonials** are
  pages. A "listing" is a page whose body links to the items — nothing generates it, and
  nothing needs to.
- **A legal document is a page plus one line of configuration.** `legal[]` in
  `site.config.json` decides which policy documents the footer surfaces, in order, and
  configuration decides *exposure* while the page decides *existence* — a configured
  slug with no page is simply never linked:
  `content/pages/markdown/<site>/<language>/legal/privacy.md` → `/<site>/<language>/legal/privacy`.
- **There is no content feature flag.** A deployment hides a page by not linking to it,
  not by switching a capability off.

> **The author-facing guides ship with the product.** `content/README.md` is the map,
> `content/pages/markdown/README.md` lists exactly what you can write,
> `content/pages/json/README.md` is the field-by-field guide to the advanced mode, and
> `content/assets/README.md` covers artwork. This manual is the operating procedure;
> those files are the author's own reference.

## Metadata

Markdown frontmatter is **optional**, and exactly **two** keys are supported — `title`
and `description`. A file that is nothing but prose is a complete page: the title comes
from `title:`, then the page's own first `#` heading, then readable words from the
filename, and a description is never invented.

A **JSON** page has no frontmatter: it declares its own metadata inside the document
(`schemaVersion`, `title`, `description`) — see the advanced-mode section above.

- **A misspelled or unknown key fails the build by name.** There are no secret Markdown
  commands — no shortcodes, directives, embedded JSON or pseudo-components — so anything
  the mode does not support is reported rather than silently ignored.
- Keep imagery references pointing at real files that exist under `content/assets/`.
- Alt text / image semantics matter: meaningful images need meaningful alt text;
  purely decorative images must be marked decorative (empty alt) rather than
  mis-described.

## Locales and dictionaries

### Language folders: the simple form and the explicit form

A language folder is a **locale path key**, and it is always lowercase.

The **simple form** is the bare language. Inside a country site, Foundation derives the
country context from the site itself:

```text
ca/en  →  en-CA        ca/fr  →  fr-CA        ch/de  →  de-CH
```

The **explicit form** — language plus region, or language plus script — is for when the
exact dialect, script or region matters:

```text
ca/fr-fr       tw/zh-hant       tw/zh-hant-tw
```

- URLs and folders stay **lowercase** (`/ca/fr-fr/about`); the **canonical language tag** used
  in standards-facing metadata and hreflang uses the usual casing
  (`fr-FR`, `zh-Hant`, `zh-Hant-TW`).
- A **Worldwide** site (`ww`) makes no country assumption of its own: `ww/fr` may simply be
  canonical `fr`. A deployment that wants a convention states it explicitly — for example
  `ww/en → en-US` — and Foundation then uses that. Do not assume every Worldwide language
  gains a country variant.

> **Two language folders that mean the same locale are a HARD configuration error.**
> `ca/en` and `ca/en-ca` both mean `en-CA`, so a site may configure one of them, never both.
> Foundation refuses the deployment and names the collision: choose one form and use it.

This manual describes the bounded contract authors need. The complete rules of the path keys
and their canonical tags are in the Foundation's `CUSTOMIZING.md`; this is not a language-tag
specification.

### Interface wording: shared dictionaries, optional site overrides

- Interface strings (labels, headings, button text, notices) live in **locale
  dictionaries** — one JSON file per locale.
- Business prose lives in **content**, per locale.
- A dictionary is **reused across sites by language**: `config/i18n/fr.json` can carry the
  common French wording for every site that serves French.
- A site may **optionally refine** that base with a partial override of its own:

```text
config/i18n/fr.json               → the shared French wording
config/i18n/sites/ca/fr.json      → Canadian French wording
config/i18n/sites/fr/fr.json      → France wording
config/i18n/sites/ca/fr-ca.json   → an exact-locale refinement (wins over the entries above)
```

Overrides are **optional** and **partial** — you supply only the keys you want to change. An
**unknown key fails the build by name**, and **another site's override is never consulted**,
so one country's wording can never leak into another's pages. Where a deployment uses an
explicit locale folder, the exact-locale dictionary for it refines the language base in the
same way.
- The **canonical language** is the one the business actually writes in; other
  locales are translations of it. Keep the canonical locale complete and correct
  first.
- **Translation handling:** when adding a locale, supply real translations for the
  dictionary values and the content that matters. Do not machine-translate legal or
  financial statements without review, and never publish a locale that makes claims
  the canonical copy does not.
- **Dictionary keys are structure; values are yours.** Never rename or restructure
  keys to fit a translation — add required keys when a release demands them, and
  otherwise change values only.

## Writing rules for business copy

- Keep contact details, service area and CTA language consistent across every page.
- Prefer claims the business can substantiate. No unsupported awards, certifications,
  guarantees, or legally/financially sensitive statements.
- For demonstration/fictional sites, keep everything clearly fictional and never
  present invented reviews, addresses or people as real.
- Reserve space in your mind for the **long-content case**: a legitimate long email
  address, long navigation label or long business name is a layout test, not an edge
  case. Content must be real input the template handles gracefully.

## Procedure for a content change

**Saving a file does not publish it.** An edited file reaches the live site only when it
is committed and pushed, so every content change follows the whole sequence — the same
one the rest of these manuals use:

```text
edit
→ save
→ review/status   (git status, git diff)
→ stage           (git add <file>)
→ commit          (git commit -m "...")
→ push            (git push)
→ automated checks build the site
```

1. **Edit** the page file(s) — and the dictionary values if interface copy changes. For a
   JSON page, confirm the file is valid JSON first (the build also reports it, by file and
   property). Keep imagery references valid, and add the artwork under `content/assets/`
   when a page needs a new image.
2. **Save** the file.
3. **Review** what changed (`git status`, `git diff`): the diff must be exactly the
   change you intended.
4. **Stage** the files you edited: `git add content/pages/markdown/ca/en/opening-hours.md`
   (or `git add content/` for a batch you have already reviewed).
5. **Commit**: `git commit -m "Update opening hours page"`.
6. **Push**: `git push`.
7. **Let the automated checks run.** The pushed commit is built and checked; a red check
   is yours to fix in the same task — never silence a check to make it pass.
8. **Validate locally where it matters** (`validation.md`): route validation, the build
   and the browser matrix.
9. **Confirm the rendered page**: correct copy, no overflow, correct imagery semantics.
10. **Confirm the live page** after deployment (`deployment.md`): the expected route
    returns 200 and the rendered content is the change you pushed.
11. Update any project documentation that quotes the changed content.

> A saved-but-uncommitted file cannot be pushed, and an unpushed commit cannot reach the
> site. That is the entire workflow — there is no separate publishing step.

## Common mistakes

- Writing a routable page anywhere other than `content/pages/` (or artwork outside
  `content/assets/`).
- Editing `public/assets/` by hand — it is a **generated mirror** of `content/assets/`;
  run `pnpm assets:sync` (see `branding-and-assets.md`).
- Editing a dictionary key structure instead of its values.
- Adding an image reference without adding the file.
- Assuming another language or another site reuses the same files: each language mirrors the folder
  structure inside its own site's tree, so a translated page is authored again under its own
  account (ca/fr/...), and a page of one site is never the page of another.
- Publishing translations that are incomplete or that change claims.
- Inventing a section type, property or presentation option in a JSON page — the
  vocabulary **is** the schema, and anything else stops the build by name.
- Trying to style a JSON page (class names, CSS, pixel values) — presentation is chosen
  from the fixed options, never written.
- Expecting a page that exists in one site to appear in another because the language matches:
  there is **no cross-site fallback** — each site answers only from its own tree.
- Configuring two language folders that mean the same locale (`ca/en` together with
  `ca/en-ca`, both meaning `en-CA`): Foundation refuses it — choose one form.
- Naming a site folder something that is not a recognized lowercase country code, or `ww`:
  `main`, `canada` and `my-office` are not sites, and their pages are never published.
- Creating a **site** because a business opened another office: an office is a **location**
  inside the existing site. A site is for a genuinely separate website with its own pages.- Treating a content-length failure as a styling problem instead of a real content input.
