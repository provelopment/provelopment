# Provelopment Foundation Instruction Manuals

> **Manual system:** Provelopment Foundation Instruction Manuals
> **Manual revision:** `2026-09-30.1`
> **Content model described:** the **Foundation installation model** — one immutable Foundation release (`provelopment-foundation-vYYYYMMDD.HHMM`; the grandfathered first release is `v2026.09.30-foundation-release-initial`) established into one autonomous **Foundation installation** that owns its own authored capsule, its own adoption record (`deployment/foundation-baseline.json`) and its own generated operational state, and serves its own **spokes**, each with **Site** contexts — together with the delivered authoring model those installations serve: two page modes (safe Markdown and declarative JSON), the page title as a page's only level-1 heading, and pages addressed per site and language
> **Procedure validation:** exercised end to end on 2026-09-30 against the public Foundation product at `3698c318779d9695f98edc803854a5af6bb01b5f`: the repository gate, a deterministic release construction (`provelopment-foundation-v20990101.0000`, 368 files, digest `sha256:c29845a3…`), a disposable establishment from the real `deployment/` capsule, and the installation-owned gate. No immutable Foundation release other than `v2026.09.30-foundation-release-initial` exists, and this revision claims validation against no release tag.
> **Adopter baseline:** the installation's own adoption record — `deployment/foundation-baseline.json` inside the installation's capsule. An adopter's own governance record is the adopter's; it is never the Foundation's adoption record.
> **Master authority:** maintained in the Provelopment governance repository (private; not part of this product)
>
> This copy is **distributed** and byte-identical to the master revision above — SHA-256
> verified at propagation — and is never edited in place: edit the master upstream and
> propagate.

## How to read the version header

Five different Foundation references are easy to confuse, and confusing them is how
a project ends up claiming a baseline it never acquired. They are defined here and
nowhere else; every manual's header uses exactly these terms.

| Term | Meaning | Where it lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Manual revision** | The version of this manual **set**. Bumped when the procedures change. Not a Foundation release. | The header of every manual + the version table below. |
| **Content model described** | The **model this manual set teaches**: the installation model (one immutable release → one autonomous installation with its own capsule, adoption record and generated state, serving its own spokes and Sites) plus the authoring model an installation serves (the two page modes, the single-H1 rule, pages addressed per site and language). It is recorded separately from *procedure validation* because a model can be documented truthfully before its procedures are re-exercised end to end; the two move independently. | The header of every manual. |
| **Procedure validation** | The ref and date at which this manual set's procedures were last exercised **end to end, with recorded evidence** — for *any* procedure in the set. It states what was actually run. Where no immutable release exists at that ref, the header says so instead of implying a release it was validated against. | The header of every manual. |
| **Adopter baseline** | The Foundation release a **specific project** actually runs. Independent per project. For an installation, the authority is its own adoption record, `deployment/foundation-baseline.json`, written by establishment. | The installation's capsule. A repository-shaped project keeps its own governance record for this, and that file is **not** the Foundation's adoption record. |
| **Target ref** | The immutable ref an operator **deliberately chooses when adopting a newer release** (an immutable release identity, or a full commit SHA — never a moving branch name). | The operator's own record of that adoption. The platform ships no automated upgrade executor (`foundation-upgrade.md`). |

A manual revision and a project baseline move **independently**: the manuals can
improve without any project moving, and a project can adopt a newer release without
the manuals changing. `2026-09-11.1`, for example, was the manual revision a `f5c94da` adopter
recorded while the master was already documenting `1114759`.

## Purpose

A Foundation adoption delivers **two** things, and both are required:

1. **The platform** — an immutable Foundation release. An installation is *established* from one;
   a repository-shaped project carries a committed snapshot of one.
2. **The operating knowledge** — how to configure, customize, adopt a newer release, validate,
   deploy and maintain it correctly.

This package is item 2. Without it an adopter receives a code snapshot and no
safe way to operate it: they cannot know which material is platform-owned, which
is theirs, what "done" means, or how to absorb a newer Foundation release
without destroying their own business content and branding.

These manuals are written for **downstream coding agents and developers**. They
are operational procedure, not marketing.

## Authority

| | Location | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Master** | the maintainer's private governance repository (not part of this product) | Authoritative. All edits happen here. |
| **Distributed** | `<project>/instruction-manuals/` in every Foundation-derived repository carrying a copy | A verbatim copy for readers working inside that project. Never edited directly. |

**Edit rule:** a distributed copy is never edited independently. If a manual is
wrong or incomplete, fix the master, review it, then propagate. Two divergent
copies of the same procedure are a process defect.

The version header at the top of every manual makes the provenance
self-describing: a reader working only inside an adopter repository can see where
the manual came from, which Foundation baseline it applies to, and that their
copy is distributed.

This package documents the **public Foundation product** and the workflows of a
project built from it. The private governance repository that maintains it is not
part of this product and is not required in order to use these manuals.

## Propagation procedure

Run this when the master changes, and once per accepted Foundation release.
Concrete commands for a particular workspace belong to that workspace's own
governance documentation, not to these distributed manuals.

1. **Update the master** — edit the master copy only. Never edit a distributed copy.
2. **Review** — read the changed manual end to end; confirm it is actionable and
   consistent with the manuals it cross-references. Bump the header revision if warranted.
3. **Copy the complete file set** — propagate every master file, so additions and
   edits always travel. Copy **explicitly**; do **not** mirror destructively
   (`robocopy /MIR`, `rsync --delete`). A copy is reviewable, and a file that has
   genuinely disappeared from the master is removed from the receivers as its own
   deliberate, visible step:

   ```powershell
   Copy-Item '<master>\*.md'  '<receiver>\instruction-manuals\' -Force
   ```

   ```bash
   cp <master>/*.md <receiver>/instruction-manuals/
   ```

4. **Verify the exact file list** — the copies must contain exactly the master's
   files: no extras, no omissions.
5. **Verify byte/hash parity** — see below. Not optional.
6. **Update the receiving project's records** — the receiving project records the manual revision it
   now carries in its own governance. Never write a manual revision into an installation's adoption
   record (`deployment/foundation-baseline.json`): that file describes the release an installation
   runs, and establishment owns it.
7. **Commit the receiving repository** — separately from the master commit, with
   a conventional message naming the manual revision.

## Parity verification

Substitute `<master>` and `<receiver>` with the two locations being compared; the
check is identical in every workspace.

**PowerShell (Windows):**

```powershell
$master = '<master>'
$copy   = '<receiver>'
$a = Get-ChildItem $master -File | Sort-Object Name
$b = Get-ChildItem $copy   -File | Sort-Object Name
if ($a.Count -ne $b.Count) { Write-Host "FILE-COUNT MISMATCH: $($a.Count) vs $($b.Count)" }
foreach ($f in $a) {
  $h1 = (Get-FileHash $f.FullName -Algorithm SHA256).Hash
  $h2 = if (Test-Path (Join-Path $copy $f.Name)) { (Get-FileHash (Join-Path $copy $f.Name) -Algorithm SHA256).Hash } else { 'MISSING' }
  '{0,-28} {1}' -f $f.Name, $(if ($h1 -eq $h2) { 'MATCH' } else { 'DIFF' })
}
```

**bash / macOS / Linux:**

```bash
diff -r '<master>' '<receiver>' && echo 'PARITY OK'
```

`diff -r` is silent and exits 0 only when every file is byte-identical — that is
the acceptance evidence. No synchronization tooling is required or wanted. Parity
is verified after every propagation, and additionally whenever a receiving
project is adopted.

> `2026-09-30.1` reconciles this manual set with the **implemented Foundation model** and closes
> two release-audit blockers that lived in the documentation layer:
>
> - **Every command named is a command the platform implements.** The previously published
>   `pnpm validate` and `pnpm setup` were **never** Foundation scripts (`validate` does not exist;
>   `setup` is pnpm's own built-in, which changes global pnpm/`PATH` state). The gate is now stated
>   per **ownership context** — Foundation repository, independent installation, and
>   deployment/spoke change — in `validation.md`; each context names only real commands, and
>   `pnpm test:foundation` is no longer presented as an installation acceptance gate.
> - **Release identity, provenance and acquisition are stated as implemented.**
>   `provelopment-foundation-vYYYYMMDD.HHMM` is the identity future releases use;
>   `v2026.09.30-foundation-release-initial` is the grandfathered first release; historical
>   checkpoint tags (`v<YYYY.MM.DD>-foundation-<slug>`) are **evidence**, never a current identity;
>   the installation's adoption record is `deployment/foundation-baseline.json`; the canonical
>   GitHub repository is the default public **source** of releases, never a runtime dependency; and
>   a project's own `platform/SOURCE.md`/`FOUNDATION_SOURCE.md` is the project's governance record,
>   not the Foundation's.
>
> The vendored-platform adoption and upgrade material is **retained but explicitly marked
> HISTORICAL** (`adoption.md`, `foundation-upgrade.md`), and `foundation-upgrade.md` now states
> plainly that the automated in-place upgrade executor, staging deployer, health probe, production
> promoter and rollback executor are **not implemented** in this release.
>
> This revision was propagated to **every** documented receiver as one change, and byte parity was
> re-verified (see *Parity verification*).

> `2026-09-27.3` updates this set to the **final delivered Foundation architecture**: the

> (`content/pages/markdown/<site>/<language>/<page>.md`), a page's identity is **site + locale

> locations); the **four independent visitor dimensions** (Site, Language, Location, Layout,
> with unneeded controls simply absent); the **site-bounded page resolution order**
> (exact-language JSON → exact-language Markdown → site default-language JSON when the site's
> configured fallback permits → site default-language Markdown → not found); and the hard rule
> that **a missing page is never satisfied from another site**, merely because the language or
> route matches.
>
> **Localization now documented.** The **simple and explicit locale forms** (`ca/fr` → `fr-CA`,
> with `ca/fr-fr`, `tw/zh-hant`, `tw/zh-hant-tw` for exact dialect, script or region),
> lowercase paths in URLs with canonical tag casing in standards-facing metadata, the absence of

> is an explicit deployment choice), **duplicate effective locales as a HARD configuration
> error** (`ca/en` together with `ca/en-ca`, both meaning `en-CA` — choose one), and the
> **shared-dictionary + optional per-site override** model (`config/i18n/fr.json` refined by
> `config/i18n/sites/ca/fr.json`: optional, partial, unknown keys fail, and another site's
> override is never consulted).
>
> **Authoring modes and the heading contract.** The two-mode model is unchanged in principle —
> simple safe Markdown and advanced declarative JSON, sharing one `site → language → route`
> addressing model, with no collections. `content-management.md` now states the delivered
> **single-H1 Markdown contract**: the page title is a page's only level-1 heading, and headings
> written inside a page are placed underneath it automatically (`#` renders level 2, `##` level
> 3, and so on, capping at level 6), so an author never has to start at `##` and no heading is
> removed. The JSON heading contract is unchanged and stated only for consistency (page title 1,
> section heading 2, item heading 3), with advanced authors pointed at
> `content/pages/json/README.md`. `site-customization.md` states which configuration may differ
> per site (navigation, footer navigation, legal destinations, Connect, the CTA's page

## Manual index

| Manual | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| [`foundation-upgrade.md`](foundation-upgrade.md) | Adopting a newer Foundation release without damaging project-owned material — and knowing what the platform does and does not implement. |
| [`adoption.md`](adoption.md) | Creating a new project: the current **Foundation installation** workflow first, with repository-shaped adoption kept as clearly marked historical context. |
| [`site-customization.md`](site-customization.md) | Changing identity, navigation, CTA, presentation, theme, contact or metadata **without touching source**. |
| [`branding-and-assets.md`](branding-and-assets.md) | Replacing logos, favicon, banners, sidebar icons or imagery; runtime roles vs business files. |
| [`content-management.md`](content-management.md) | Writing/editing pages (the simple Markdown mode, or the **delivered** advanced declarative JSON mode), the artwork under `content/assets/`, legal documents and dictionaries. |
| [`validation.md`](validation.md) | Before claiming any task complete; understanding what each gate proves. |
| [`deployment.md`](deployment.md) | Taking a validated repository live and verifying production. |
| [`agent-operating-rules.md`](agent-operating-rules.md) | Operating inside an adopter project: authority, boundaries, **the access boundary and evidence classes**, escalation, handoff. |
| [`troubleshooting.md`](troubleshooting.md) | A known recurring failure with a known safe resolution. |

Full configuration schema reference lives in the Foundation's `CUSTOMIZING.md`;
architecture in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. These manuals point at them rather than
duplicating them.

Lower-level contracts live with the code that owns them; these manuals link rather than copy:

| Contract | Document |
| --- | --- |
| Release construction, verification and classification | `scripts/release/README.md` |
| Establishment (release + capsule → installation) | `scripts/installation/README.md` |
| The release identity / manifest / digest contract | `src/core/foundation-release/README.md` |
| The installation lifecycle contract | `src/core/foundation-installation/README.md` |

## Retirement policy

Obsolete procedures are **updated**, **consolidated**, or **removed** — never left
active beside their replacement.

- One procedure, one home. If a manual duplicates a project document, keep the
  manual (it is distributed) and reduce the project document to a pointer.
- Superseded guidance is rewritten in place; the version table records the change.
- Dead guidance is deleted. Historically interesting material belongs in project
  history/archives, not in a manual an agent will follow.
- **Contradictory active instructions are not allowed.**

## What this package is not

- Not a substitute for `CUSTOMIZING.md` (schema reference) or `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Not a changelog or release history.
- Not a place for project-specific business facts (customer briefs, site copy) —
  those are adopter-owned content.
