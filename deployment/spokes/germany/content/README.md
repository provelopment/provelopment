# Your website's content — start here

**Everything you write or upload for your website lives in this folder.** If you are
asking *"where do I edit my website?"*, you are in the right place.

Every path written in this folder is relative to **this deployment**: `content/…` means
the deployment's own content folder — in the repository that hosts this reference
deployment that is `deployment/spokes/germany/content/…`.

```text
content/
├── README.md            ← this file: the map
├── pages/               ← every page of your website
│   ├── markdown/        ←   the simple way: text files
│   │   └── <language>/<page>.md
│   └── json/            ←   the advanced way: structured data
│       └── <language>/<page>.json
└── assets/              ← your logo, favicon, images and icons
```

**The rule that makes it simple:** if something has its own web address, it is a
**page** and it goes in `pages/`. If it only ever appears *inside* another page — a
customer quote, a row in a table, a card in a list — you write it in that page. There
are no other places to author website content, and nothing else to learn.

| I want to… | Go to | Read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add or edit a **page** in plain Markdown (the usual choice) | `pages/markdown/<language>/<page>.md` | [`pages/markdown/README.md`](pages/markdown/README.md) |
| Build an **advanced page** from structured data | `pages/json/<language>/<page>.json` | [`pages/json/README.md`](pages/json/README.md) |

Both modes give a page exactly **one** top-level heading — its **page title**. A heading you
write inside a page sits below that title automatically (`# Services` becomes the first level
under it, `## …` the second), so you write headings naturally and never set a level yourself.

> **Where do I edit my website?** — the page files above, and your pictures in
> [`assets/`](assets/README.md). Everything else is configuration, not content.
| Add a **logo, favicon, icon or image** | `assets/` | [`assets/README.md`](assets/README.md) |

## Pages: two ways to author, one obvious choice

- **Markdown** — ordinary text files. If you can write an email, you can write a
  page. This is what almost everyone should use, and it is safe by design.
- **JSON** — structured data for an experienced author who needs page composition
  Markdown cannot express: a title, a summary and an ordered list of sections from a
  fixed vocabulary (hero, prose, images, cards, features, steps, table, FAQ, and more).
  It is data, never code, and everything it may say is documented in that folder's
  README.

A page becomes a real web address as soon as its file exists in a language folder —
you never have to "register" a page anywhere.

## A page's address comes from its folders

Any page **inside** your site gets its address from where you put the file:

**How an address is built: mode → site → language → page.** **Choose your site, choose its
language, then create the page.** The folders are the address — nothing else needs
configuring.

```text
content/pages/markdown/ca/en/about.md   →   /ca/en/about
content/pages/markdown/ca/fr/about.md   →   /ca/fr/about
content/pages/markdown/fr/fr/about.md   →   /fr/fr/about
```

- **mode** — which authoring mode the page is written in: `markdown/` (simple, safe) or
  `json/` (advanced). You choose one per page.
- **site** — which website the page belongs to: a recognized two-letter country code
  (`ca`, `fr`, `ch`…) or `ww` for a worldwide/global site. See
  [`COUNTRY-CODES.md`](COUNTRY-CODES.md) for the complete list.
- **language** — the language, written as a lowercase path key (`en`, `fr`, `fr-ca`).
- **page** — the page's own path: one name (`about`) or a folder plus a name
  (`services/web-design`).

A language you did not name is simply not offered on that site, and pages of one site are
never served by another — each site is an independent website inside this one repository.

Sites can also use an **explicit** language when the exact dialect matters:

```
content/pages/markdown/ca/fr-fr/about.md   →   /ca/fr-fr/about
```

### A section is a folder

Its own page and the pages inside it live side by side, and both are addresses:

```text
content/pages/markdown/de/de/services.md                 →  /de/de/services
content/pages/markdown/de/de/services/web-design.md      →  /de/de/services/web-design
content/pages/markdown/de/de/blog/choosing-a-domain.md   →  /de/de/blog/choosing-a-domain
```

So a section with its own pages is just a folder. Nothing needs configuring, and the
section's own page (`services.md`) and its pages (`services/web-design.md`) live
happily side by side.

## Languages

Pages are organised by language: the folder name is a language code such as `en`
(English) or `de` (German). Another language mirrors the same structure exactly:

```text
content/pages/markdown/de/de/services.md                  →  /de/de/services
content/pages/markdown/de/de/services/web-design.md       →  /de/de/services/web-design

content/pages/markdown/de/en/services.md                  →  /de/en/services
content/pages/markdown/de/en/services/web-design.md       →  /de/en/services/web-design
```

The languages your site serves are configured in `site.config.json`; a language
folder you create but have not configured yet simply publishes nothing. If a page has
no translation in the visitor's language, the default language's page answers instead.

## Content versus configuration

- **`content/` = what you write.** Words, images, documents — the material of the
  website.
- **`site.config.json`, `config/` = how the site behaves.** Your business name,
  phone number, colours, menu entries, which optional features are switched on.

You change your text and images in `content/`. You change settings — including which
language is the default, and what appears in the navigation — in
`site.config.json`.

## Sites and locations

A **site** is an independent website: its own pages, its own languages, its own locations. The
folder directly under `pages/<mode>/` is the site code, so `ww` (Global) and `de` (Germany) are
two separate page trees in this repository — nothing is shared between them, and neither one
answers for the other.

A **location** is a physical or service place *inside* one site. It shares that site's page tree:
its landing page is authored exactly like any other page, with the location's name as the file
name and folder:

```text
content/pages/markdown/de/de/berlin.md          →  /de/de/berlin
content/pages/markdown/de/de/frankfurt.md       →  /de/de/frankfurt
content/pages/markdown/de/en/berlin.md          →  /de/en/berlin
```

The locations themselves (their name, time zone, address) are configured in `site.config.json`
under `business.regions`, and which site + language each one is reachable in is declared under
`business.pages`. A location does **not** get its own languages: languages belong to the site, so
every location in a site is readable in every language that site offers.

The reference deployment's Germany site, its Berlin and Frankfurt locations and their placeholder
addresses are **demonstration data** for you to replace with your own.

## Saving is not publishing

Editing a file on your own computer does not change the live website. A change
becomes part of the site when it is **committed and pushed**:

```text
edit the file
→ save it
→ review what changed   (git status)
→ stage it              (git add <file>)
→ commit it             (git commit -m "Update About page")
→ push it               (git push)
→ automated checks build the site
```

Each folder's README shows the exact commands for its files. If you have never used
Git, follow that sequence literally: it is the whole workflow, and it works the same
way for every file in this folder.

## Two things that are deliberate, not mistakes

- **A `README.md` is never a page.** Documentation is safe to keep beside your
  content — at the top level or inside any folder — because only files whose names are
  ordinary lowercase page names can become pages.
- **An empty folder publishes nothing.** You can prepare a language or a section
  before you have anything to put in it; it creates no page and no address.
