/**
 * THE AUTHORING SURFACE THIS DEPLOYMENT ACTUALLY SHIPS (FOUNDATION-MULTISITE-M20)
 * =============================================================================
 *
 * M20 finishes what an author meets when they open this repository's authored material: documentation at
 * every intermediate authoring root, empty-locale behaviour proved (in `tests/unit/page-authoring-
 * directory-contract.test.ts`, on a disposable tree), the Foundation-owned English About in place, and the
 * retired Site-control copy reconciled.
 *
 * This is DEPLOYMENT scope: it asserts the REAL capsule, through the accepted authorities, so a future
 * authoring change cannot quietly undo the contract — a missing `README.md`, a rewritten About page, or a
 * page that starts advertising a Site control again all fail here, by name.
