/**
 * THE INSTALLED DEPLOYMENT'S ASSET INSTALL (FOUNDATION-DEPLOYMENT-ISO-H2)
 * ======================================================================
 *
 * Everything here is a fact about the deployment THIS repository currently installs — which artwork and
 * documentation it ships, and whether its generated runtime mirror still matches its sources. Those
 * assertions belong to the deployment's own acceptance suite (ISO-B2A), not to the generic Foundation
 * contracts: the mirror is generated FROM the selected deployment, so it can only be checked where that
 * deployment is the subject.
 *
 * They were MOVED here by ISO-H2 from four generic suites (`tests/unit/sidebar-page-icon-contract`,
 * `brand-asset-swap-contract`, `p12-hg-header-graphic`, and the asset taxonomy/mirror suite) which used
 * to read `<repo>/content/assets/**` through `process.cwd()`. That worked only while the deployment
 * happened to sit at the repository root, and would have broken — or worse, silently checked nothing —
 * the moment the deployment moved into its capsule (ISO-B2B). The generic suites now assert the RULES
 * against whichever deployment the run selected; the INSTALL is asserted here.
 *
 * ISO-H2 also owns `deployment/tests/unit/asset-taxonomy-mirror.test.ts` (the shipped pack and its
 * mirror relationship) and `deployment/tests/unit/country-code-reference.test.ts` (the shipped
 * country-code document versus the platform's authority) for the same reason.

 * `public/assets`, or the Spoke's own at `public/spokes/<segment>/assets`). The platform path is the
 * fallback, so an assertion about a file NO namespace ships still reads as an ordinary missing-file check
 * rather than as a crash.
