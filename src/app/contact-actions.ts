 * Server Action backing the contact form (Phase B).
 *
 * Thin framework boundary: reads the raw FormData, resolves the configured
 * sender from `features.contact` + runtime environment variables (read lazily
 * here so production secrets are never required at build time), and delegates
 * to the application-layer orchestration.
 *
 * Security model (Next.js 16, documented): actions are POST-only endpoints
 * with an implicit per-build Action ID. Next.js enforces a same-origin check —
 * the request Origin is compared against the request Host (and the
 * `experimental.serverActions.allowedOrigins` set when configured); a
 * mismatch is rejected with HTTP 403. This is Next.js's CSRF mitigation. The
 * honeypot handled in `handleContactSubmission` adds a bot-defense layer
 * beyond the framework's protection.
