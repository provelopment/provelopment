/**
 * THE PUBLIC DOCUMENT BOUNDARY — the ROOT layout of the site-scoped URL space (FOUNDATION-MULTISITE-M16/M17)
 * =========================================================================================================
 *
 * S1 — the ROOT layout of a SITE-SCOPED URL space: `/{site}/{locale}/...`. The document's `lang`, the
 * dictionary, the navigation, the footer and every internal URL belong to ONE site; that site and locale are
 * resolved by the SAME request-selected context the page uses, inside `./request-context`.
 *
 * WHICH SPOKE (M17). It is NOT decided here and NOT decided by this file's callers: the request boundary
 * matched the exact hostname claim and declared its Spoke on a private upstream header, and
 * `./request-context` turns that declaration into an explicit `SpokeRuntimeContext` — or refuses. This file
 * reads no hostname, holds no global configuration, and never falls back to a first or default Spoke.
 *
 * WHAT STAYS HERE is the STATIC PLATFORM: the brand typography, the stylesheet import, the mobile-browser
 * chrome colors. Those are facts about this deployment's platform — not about a request — so they are
 * module-level and are never turned into request state.
 *
 * REQUEST-TIME RENDERING (M17). The selected Spoke is known only from the request, so this route
 * deliberately generates no static parameters and claims no static pathname: the SAME public pathname is
 * rendered per host, from that host's own context. Site/locale completion still redirects incomplete public
 * paths (a bare Site, an unknown locale) to their completed public URL.
