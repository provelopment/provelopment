/**
 * THE PORTS ESTABLISHMENT NEEDS (FOUNDATION-B4B)
 * =============================================
 *
 * `src/application/establish-foundation-installation.ts` composes ONE complete Foundation installation
 * inside an explicitly supplied target root. It must not know HOW content is read, HOW bytes are written,
 * where a release came from or which cryptography a digest uses, so each of those is a port here.
 *
 * THE WRITE BOUNDARY IS STRUCTURAL, NOT A CONVENTION
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * `FoundationInstallationTarget.write` accepts only ROOT-RELATIVE POSIX PATHS. There is no absolute path in
 * the contract, so the use case cannot address anything outside the target root even by mistake, and the
 * implementation owns the one guard that resolves each path inside the root it was constructed for. A
 * bootstrap may therefore write nothing but the installation it is establishing — never the source
 * installation, another installation, the platform's own checkout or a user's home directory.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. No port for a registry, a fleet, a control plane, GitHub, polling or
 * "the latest release": an installation is established from ONE named immutable release supplied by an
 * acquisition source, and it is complete when it has been materialised. No port declares a staging
 * environment or a rollback executor either — those are later phases, and B4B's establishment is the
 * smallest mechanism that creates an installation at all.
 *
 * WHAT IS REUSED. The clock, the release acquisition source and the installation's operational state store
 * are the ports FOUNDATION-B4A already declared (`./foundation-installation-ports`), so establishment
 * drives the SAME lifecycle contract and writes the SAME record as every future mechanic will.
