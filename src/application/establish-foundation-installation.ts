/**
 * ESTABLISHING ONE COMPLETE FOUNDATION INSTALLATION (FOUNDATION-B4B)
 * ==================================================================
 *
 * The use case behind `pnpm installation:establish`: given ONE named immutable Foundation release, ONE
 * authored installation seed and ONE explicit target root, it materialises a complete installation and
 * records the lifecycle facts that make the result checkable.
 *
 * THE SEQUENCE IS THE APPROVED LIFECYCLE, NOT A PARALLEL ONE
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * Establishment drives `@/core/foundation-installation` step by step, and every step it records is a
 * transition that contract already defines for a FRESH INSTALL:
 *
 *   startInstallationAttempt(install, target = the release)   the attempt begins, stage "preparing"
 *   … materialise into the target root …                      payload + PORTABLE seed + adoption record
 *   recordInstallationCandidate(candidate)                    the candidate tree exists, identity known
 *   recordInstallationCandidateValidated()                    identity checked: seed shape, release continuity
 *   recordInstallationCandidateStaged()                       materialised into the installation root
 *   recordInstallationStagingInspected()                      the installation verified itself
 *   beginInstallationPromotion() / completeInstallationPromotion(candidate)
 *                                                             the candidate becomes LIVE; health stays
 *                                                             offline until something really evaluates it
 *   the operational record is written                         the LAST act — the completion marker
 *
 * A SEED MAY BE ANOTHER INSTALLATION'S CAPSULE, and then what travels is its PORTABLE authored material: the
 * source installation's own records — its adoption record, and generated operational state, which is refused
 * outright — are never inherited, so the new installation records its OWN adoption of the release it is
 * established from (`@/core/foundation-installation/establishment`).
 *
 * A candidate is the only thing that can be promoted, and promotion re-checks the exact identity (release +
 * authored digest + materialised digest), so what goes live is provably the artifact this establishment
 * materialised.
 *
 * FAILURE SEMANTICS: NOTHING IS EVER MISTAKEN FOR SUCCESS
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * The operational record is the ONE durable artefact that says "this installation exists", and it is written
 * once, at the END, only after the installation has been materialised and its identity verified. Therefore a
 * failure before it exists leaves an unactivated target — no record, nothing live — and a re-run REFUSES the
 * non-empty target rather than overwriting it, so a partial installation can never be mistaken for a
 * successful one. A failure after it exists is impossible by construction, because writing it is the last
 * step.
 *
 * The failure is reported in the platform's own failure vocabulary (`InstallationFailureCategory`) rather
 * than as an arbitrary exception: `release-resolution` when the release cannot be obtained or is not the
 * artifact it claims to be, `installation-validation` when the authored input or the candidate identity is
 * not a valid Foundation installation, `materialization` when nothing can be written where it must go
 * (including an unsafe target root), `promotion` when becoming live — or recording that it did — failed.
 *
 * WHAT ESTABLISHMENT DOES *NOT* DO: it installs no dependencies, runs no build and no tests, creates no Git
 * repository, publishes nothing and creates no tag. Proving that the established installation can install,
 * build and test ITSELF is a separate act with its own evidence (`instruction-manuals/adoption.md`). It also
 * never reads the source installation at run time: the only inputs are the release payload, the seed and the
 * target, so once establishment succeeds the source is irrelevant to operation.
 *
 * Framework-neutral: ports in, plain data out. No filesystem, no clock, no network, no Git, no framework.
