/**
 * ONE SPOKE'S RUNTIME DICTIONARY ACCESS (FOUNDATION-MULTISITE-S3F2A2-D1)
 * =====================================================================
 *
 *     SpokeRuntimeContext                     an EXPLICIT, immutable context — handed in, never resolved
 *     (its own resources + its own
 *      resolved configuration)
 *             └──────────────────┬──────────────────┘
 *         dictionaryAccessForRuntimeContext(context)
 *                                ↓
 *                       RuntimeDictionaryAccess      one immutable answer object, scoped to THAT context
 *
 * THE ONLY NEW FACT IS THE BINDING. The registry is composed by the accepted per-Spoke loader
 * (`./spoke-dictionaries`), which delegates to the ONE dictionary-registry loader — so dictionary
 * schema validation, declared-locale validation, the language-base fallback, the default locale, the
 * site+locale overrides and their refusal cases, and the missing-dictionary failures are all decided
 * there and restated nowhere.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 * ----------------------------------
 * It resolves no context, reads no configuration file, discovers no root and names no deployment
 * location: a caller must already hold the context it wants dictionaries for. It keeps no cache and
 * no selection state of any kind — there is no module-global registry and no Spoke→registry map, so
 * TWO contexts can be served in one process without influencing each other, and a context that is
 * discarded takes its dictionaries with it. The access object itself is the scope.
 *
 * The F1 booking-label invariant is applied HERE, at construction, by the ONE shared rule
 * (`./i18n/invariants`) over every EFFECTIVE (site, locale) dictionary of THIS context — so a
 * context whose enabled booking CTA would silently lose its label fails loudly when its access is
 * created, exactly as the compatibility binding fails at module load.
 *
 * ADDITIVE / UNWIRED (S3F2A2-D1). `@/config/i18n` remains the running application's ACTIVE binding;
 * nothing under `src/app/**`, `src/app/sitemap.ts`, `src/app/robots.ts` or `src/proxy.ts` imports this
 * module. Choosing which Spoke a request reads remains S3F2B's work.
 *
 * SERVER/BUILD ONLY: its answers come from files, so it must never become reachable from a client chunk.
