/**
 * THE SPOKE A REQUEST BELONGS TO (FOUNDATION-MULTISITE-M16)
 * ========================================================
 *
 * The SERVER-side seam between the request boundary and the explicit runtime context. THREE questions, all
 * answered from accepted authorities:
 *
 *     installationRuntimeIndexForBuild()   the Installation's Spokes, composed ONCE per process
 *     runtimeContextForSegment(segment)    the CONTEXT an internal route names — and nothing else
 *     runtimeContextForRequestHost(host)   the CONTEXT a public request resolves to, or NOTHING
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT
 * ---------------------------
 * It is not a second selection rule: which Spoke answers a host is decided by the pure routing table
 * (`./spoke-routing`, which consumes the build's inlined description and the domain's exact-claim match),
 * and what a Spoke IS is decided by the runtime index (`./installation-runtime`). This module only joins
 * the two, and it never guesses:
 *
 *   · MULTI (2+ declared Spokes): the host must claim a Spoke. An unclaimed hostname yields `null`, so its
 *     caller answers NOTHING — there is no default Spoke, no first Spoke and no fallback to a neighbour.
 *   · SINGLE (exactly one declared Spoke): that Spoke answers EVERY host. That is the accepted one-Spoke
 *     behaviour, preserved for development, preview and test hosts — and it is stated as "the Installation
 *     declares exactly one Spoke", never as "the first entry".
 *
 * SERVER/BUILD ONLY: it composes contexts from files, so it must never become reachable from a client chunk.
