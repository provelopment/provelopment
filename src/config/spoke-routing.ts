/**
 * THE CURRENT BUILD'S HOSTNAME ROUTING, AND WHICH SPOKE ANSWERS A HOST (FOUNDATION-MULTISITE-M16)
 * ==============================================================================================
 *
 * The REQUEST BOUNDARY's authority — and, deliberately, a PURE one: it reads the routing description the
 * build resolved and inlined (`./spoke-host-routing.mjs` ← `./deployment-build.mjs` ← `next.config.ts`),
 * derives each Spoke's exact hostname claims through the ONE pure `origin → hostname` step
 * (`@/core/spoke`'s `hostnameFromOrigin`), and answers the ONE question a request has:
 *
 *     given a raw `Host` header, which Spoke answers — or none?
 *
 * NO FILESYSTEM, NO CONFIGURATION PARSE, NO REQUEST OBJECT. That is what makes this module usable from the
 * proxy: the boundary never parses `site.config.json`, never discovers a Spoke root, never reads a
 * dictionary and never needs a page. It holds no mutable selection state either — the table is a value and a
 * decision is a pure function of it — so two Spokes cannot influence each other's answer.
 *
 * NO DEFAULT SPOKE, ANYWHERE. `spokeSelectionForHost` reuses the accepted exact-match decision
 * (`@/core/spoke`'s `resolveSpokeFromHost`) over the claims derived above: a host no Spoke claims answers
 * `null`. `single` mode means "the Installation declares exactly ONE Spoke" — the same fact the accepted
 * `currentBuildRuntimeContext()` relies on — never "the first Spoke".
