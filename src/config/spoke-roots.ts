/**
 * THE INSTALLATION'S SPOKE COLLECTION (FOUNDATION-MULTISITE-S3C1)
 * ==============================================================
 *
 * WHAT THIS ANSWERS, AND NOTHING ELSE
 * -----------------------------------
 *
 *     which Spokes belong to this Installation?
 *     what stable internal id addresses each one?
 *     where is each one authored?
 *
 * An Installation declares its Spokes in ONE authored manifest at its own root:
 *
 *     <InstallationRoot>/spokes.json     { "spokes": [ { "id": "...", "root": "spokes/..." } ] }
 *     <InstallationRoot>/spokes/…        the declared Spoke roots (the DEDICATED namespace)
 *
 * It deliberately authors NOTHING else — no hostname, no label, no locales, no assets, no
 * configuration facts. A Spoke's own identity data lives in that Spoke's `site.config.json`, and its
 * canonical hostname is DERIVED from that file's `site.url` in a LATER slice (S3D+); authoring it here
 * would create a second authority for one fact.
 *
 * THE NAMESPACE IS AN OWNERSHIP BOUNDARY
 * --------------------------------------
 * A declared Spoke root lives beneath `<InstallationRoot>/spokes/` — lexically AND physically. The
 * boundary is that CONTAINER, not merely the Installation root: a locator that resolves outside
 * `spokes/` (including one that leaves it through a link) is refused, so authored website material can
 * never be planted among the Installation's configuration, content or tooling. The ID stays
 * independent of the directory spelling: `spokes/foundation-web` may hold the Spoke `foundation`.
 *
 * LEGACY IS THE ABSENCE OF A MANIFEST
 * -----------------------------------
 *
 *   no `spokes.json`       LEGACY IMPLICIT: the Installation root IS the implicit Spoke root, and its
 *                          single Spoke carries the reserved `IMPLICIT_SPOKE_ID`. Nothing is authored,
 *                          nothing moves, and today's deployments are untouched.
 *   `spokes.json` present  EXPLICIT: the manifest's entries (1..*) are the Installation's Spokes.
 *   BOTH authored          REFUSED — never a precedence rule, never a silent migration.
 *   NEITHER authored       REFUSED — an Installation root must be authored one way.
 *
 * DIRECTORY PRESENCE IS INERT; A MANIFEST ENTRY IS AN ASSERTION
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * A directory under `spokes/` that the manifest does not reference creates nothing and changes no
 * mode: the manifest is the membership authority, exactly as capsule selection already probes a FILE
 * rather than a directory. Conversely an entry asserts that its root exists, is a directory, stays
 * INSIDE the Installation root and carries `site.config.json` — the root-level contract S3C1 needs for
 * safe root resolution, and no more. Loading that Spoke's configuration (its Sites, locales, Hubs,
 * content, dictionaries, assets) is S3D's business: S3C1 resolves AUTHORING ROOTS, not domain Spokes.
 *
 * ONE ROOT AUTHORITY, SHARED WITH THE BUILD SEAM
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * The Installation root is an INPUT here — this module never calls `process.cwd()`, reads an environment
 * variable or selects a layout, so `./deployment-build.mjs` remains the ONE answer to "where is the
 * Installation?" and this is the nested answer to "what does it declare?".
 *
 * The DECLARATION AND ROOT CONTRACT itself (the strict manifest shape, the identity rules, the locator
 * rules and physical containment) lives in `./spoke-declarations.mjs`, plain ESM, because the build
 * selection seam must answer the same question and cannot execute TypeScript: this module is the TYPED
 * view of that ONE implementation, so a build can never select a declared root the configuration/domain
 * layer would refuse. The domain typing stays here; the acceptance rules do not have a second copy.
 *
 * BUILD/SERVER-ONLY: it reads the filesystem, so it must never become reachable from a client chunk.
 * A `SpokeId` is an opaque identity and a root locator is separate data: the id is never a path and the
 * path is never the identity, so the two differ freely (`spokes/foundation-web` may hold the Spoke
 * `foundation`) — while the LOCATOR must still live in the dedicated `spokes/` namespace.
