/**
 * THE INSTALLATION'S RUNTIME INDEX, AND ONE SPOKE'S RUNTIME CONTEXT (FOUNDATION-MULTISITE-S3F2A)
 * =============================================================================================
 *
 * TWO questions, answered ONCE, for every consumer that must answer them:
 *
 *     installationRuntimeIndex(root)      which Spokes does this Installation declare, COMPLETELY?
 *     runtimeContextForSpoke(index, key)  what is ONE of them, at runtime, from its identity alone?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * The accepted runtime resolves a deployment by INLINING exactly one Spoke's configuration at build time
 * (`./deployment-build.mjs`), and the application reads it from one module-global. That is correct for a
 * one-Spoke Installation and it is what production serves today — but it cannot describe an Installation
 * with two Spokes, and it cannot let two Spokes be resolved INDEPENDENTLY in the same process.
 *
 * This module adds that description WITHOUT changing which Spoke a public request selects:
 *
 *   · it describes EVERY declared Spoke (1..*), in authored manifest order, completely;
 *   · it never selects one. There is no `spokes[0]` fallback, no "first", no "default" and no implicit
 *     Foundation: selection is hostname dispatch, and that is S3F2B's act, not this one;
 *   · nothing in it is mutable. A context is a value, created from an index and an identity, and N
 *     contexts can exist at once without influencing each other.
 *
 * REUSE, NOT REINVENTION
 * ----------------------
 * Every fact comes from an authority that already owns it:
 *
 *   declared Spoke roots       ./spoke-roots            (`resolveInstallationSpokeRoots`)
 *   a Spoke's configuration    ./spoke-config           (`readSpokeSiteConfig`)
 *   identity + claims          @/core/spoke             (`configureSpoke` → canonical hostname, claims)
 *   a Spoke's authored trees   ./spoke-resources        (`spokeResourceIndexFor`)
 *   its runtime segment        ./spoke-runtime-segment  (`runtimeSegmentForSpokeId`, url/dir bases)
 *   the generated tree         ./deployment-root        (`publicAssetsDirectory`)
 *   the legacy single runtime  @/config                 (the accepted compatibility export)
 *
 * Nothing here parses a manifest, parses a Spoke id, normalizes a hostname, parses a `SiteConfig` or
 * decides where a resource root is — a second authority for any of those is exactly the drift the
 * earlier slices removed.
 *
 * SERVER/BUILD ONLY: it reads files, so it must never become reachable from a client chunk.
