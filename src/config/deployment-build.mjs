/**
 * THE DEPLOYMENT THE BUILD SELECTS (FOUNDATION-DEPLOYMENT-ISO-B1C)
 * ===============================================================
 *
 * Build/config-harness ONLY. `next.config.ts` and `vitest.config.mts` import this module; NO
 * application module may (the guard in `tests/architecture/deployment-root-guard.test.ts` proves it),
 * because it touches `node:fs` and would drag a filesystem import into a client chunk.
 *
 * It is deliberately the ONE place that answers "which deployment is this build for?" — and the
 * answer is then INLINED (`next.config.ts` → Next's `env`; `vitest.config.mts` → `test.env`) so that:
 *
 *   · `@/config/deployment-root` stays pure and client-safe (no `node:fs`, no `process.cwd()`);
 *   · the loader validates an already-selected configuration rather than reaching for a file;
 *   · and NO application module statically imports `<repo>/site.config.json`, so moving the
 *     deployment into a capsule (B2) cannot break module or build resolution.
 *
 * ISO-B1 resolved repository mode through a static `import` of the root config. That was a
 * compile-time dependency on the file's physical location: with the root `site.config.json` absent,
 * `tsc` failed with TS2307 and Turbopack with "Module not found". This module removes it — the root
 * config is now read HERE, at configuration time, like the capsule's.
 *
 * PLAIN ESM ON PURPOSE — ONE MODULE, THREE RUNTIMES (FOUNDATION-DEPLOYMENT-ISO-H1C)
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The authority is consumed by the build (`next.config.ts`), the test run (`vitest.config.mts`) and
 * the Foundation's own Node tooling (`scripts/sync-runtime-assets.mjs`), and only two of those three
 * run through a TypeScript compiler. A plain `.mjs` module is therefore the smallest stable boundary:
 *
 *   · Node executes it directly — no `--experimental-strip-types`, no loader or warning suppression;
 *   · Next and Vite import it like any other ES module (both already consume ESM);
 *   · TypeScript still sees the whole contract below, because the JSDoc types are part of the file
 *     and `tsc --noEmit` checks every call site (`next.config.ts`, `vitest.config.mts`, the guard).
 *
 * Its sibling `deployment-root.ts` stays TypeScript: that one IS compiled into application bundles and
 * is what the JSDoc `DeploymentLayout` below references — a type-only reference, erased at runtime.
 *
 * TWO AUTHORING MODES, ONE SELECTION (FOUNDATION-MULTISITE-S3F1)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------
 * An Installation is authored ONE of two ways, and this module is the ONE place that decides which:
 *
 *   legacy    `<root>/site.config.json`                the INSTALLATION ROOT is the one implicit Spoke
 *                                                      (the form an Installation authored at its root
 *                                                      uses), and the runtime resource paths are the
 *                                                      root's own.
 *   explicit  `<root>/spokes.json`                     the root DECLARES its Spokes; each one is
 *                                                      authored beneath `spokes/` and owns its own
 *                                                      `site.config.json`, configuration, content and
 *                                                      artwork.
 *
 *   BOTH authored  REFUSED (never a precedence rule).  NEITHER authored  REFUSED.
 *
 * SEVERAL SPOKES ARE SERVED BY HOSTNAME DISPATCH, AND NOTHING INVENTS A DEFAULT
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * An explicit Installation may declare several Spokes. The build then inlines NO single configuration
 * and claims NO single resource root: the request boundary answers a request with the Spoke whose
 * EXACT hostname claims match it (`./spoke-host-routing.mjs` gives it that description, and a host no
 * Spoke claims answers nothing). There is deliberately NO "first Spoke", no "default Spoke" and no
 * manifest-order rule — nothing is ever chosen for a caller who did not say which Spoke they meant.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO: it resolves DECLARED ROOTS and reads the sole Spoke's configuration so the
 * build can INLINE it. It composes no Spoke, builds no Hub, resolves no Site and validates no cross-Spoke
 * rule — `./spoke-roots`, `./spoke-config` and `./spoke-composition` stay the authorities for those.
 * The DECLARATION AND ROOT CONTRACT itself is not answered twice: `./spoke-declarations.mjs` is the ONE
 * implementation this seam and the TypeScript authority both consume, so a manifest this seam selects can
 * never be one the configuration/domain layer would refuse.
