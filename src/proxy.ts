/**
 * THE REQUEST BOUNDARY: HOSTNAME DISPATCH (FOUNDATION-MULTISITE-M16/M17)
 * =====================================================================
 *
 * ONE decision order, and no global Spoke authority anywhere in it:
 *
 *     raw request host
 *         ↓ normalizeHostname + exact claim match   (`@/core/spoke`, via `@/config/spoke-routing`)
 *     ONE Spoke — or NOTHING
 *         ↓
 *     the PUBLIC pathname, unchanged, plus a PRIVATE upstream header naming that Spoke's runtime segment
 *         ↓
 *     the public catch-all App Router route resolves that context and calls the shared composition
 *
 * WHY THE PATH IS NOT REWRITTEN (M17 supersedes M16). The public path IS the page identity: the App Router
 * can only commit a client-side transition for a path it knows, and a rewritten flight response for a
 * DIFFERENT route tree cannot be applied to the requested public route. M16 measured both consequences — a
 * stuck soft navigation while a public page tree still existed and a full document reload once it did not —
 * so the Spoke now travels out of band on a private request header and the pathname is never touched.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE STILL DOES NOT DO: it reads no `siteConfig`, holds no Site or locale inventory, and completes
 * no locale. Site/locale completion is decided inside the selected Spoke — by the route boundary that already
 * holds that Spoke's fully resolved configuration — so the boundary never needs a configuration to answer a
 * routing question, and the browser-visible URL is never anything but the public one.
 *
 * THE TWO INSTALLATION SHAPES
 * ---------------------------
 *   multi   2+ declared Spokes: the host decides. An UNCLAIMED hostname answers NOTHING (404) — it is never
 *           redirected to another Spoke, never given "the first" Spoke and never given a default.
 *   single  exactly ONE declared Spoke: that Spoke answers every host, which is the accepted one-Spoke
 *           behaviour (development, preview and test hosts included) — stated as "the sole entry the build
 *           published", never as "the first".
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED EXTRAS
 * ------------------
 *   · a DIRECT external request to the retired internal namespace (`/~spoke/**`) is refused: no page renders
 *     there, and a visitor never receives a surface that implies the namespace exists;
 *   · a Spoke's own asset namespace (`/spokes/<segment>/assets/**`) is HOST-BOUND: a host may fetch its own
 *     Spoke's artwork and never another's, even though both are generated in the same `public/` tree. The
 *     matcher below therefore also matches static (dotted) Spoke paths, while `/_next/**` and the shared
 *     `/assets/**` platform namespace stay untouched.
