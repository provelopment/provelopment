/**
 * ShellBottomBar (UI-05 — Shell Engine).
 *
 * The COMPOSED mobile "bottom-bar" layer for the Adaptive personality. It is
 * the interactive/region-aware counterpart of `ShellMobileNav`:
 *
 *  - resolves the same region-aware hrefs + active state as the site header's
 *    navigation (pure `@/core/regional-pages` helpers; content passes
 *    `pageBindings` + `locale` via props — no config import);
 *  - renders EVERY configured navigation destination DIRECTLY in the bar, in
 *    configuration order, flowing left-to-right and wrapping onto further rows
 *    as the width requires (R1 — the former "first four + More drawer" rule was
 *    RETIRED by the owner; no destination is hidden behind an overflow control);
 *  - composes ONLY the shared primitives (`BottomNavigation`, `NavItem`) — no
 *    presentation identity, no business rules.
 *
 * A11y contract (R1): ONE `<nav>` landmark (the bar) wherever the composition presents it, holding every
 * configured destination in configured order with `aria-current` on the active one; the rows WRAP at narrow
 * widths and never scroll horizontally, never truncate and never collapse into a drawer; every target keeps
 * the shared ≥44px box (`NavItem`'s own contract).
