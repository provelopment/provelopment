/**
 * R3 — THE SIDEBAR'S NAVIGATION-SELECTION POLICY, ONE BAND AT A TIME.
 * =================================================================
 *
 * What SELECTING a destination inside the rail does to an OPEN rail, per viewport band. The composer declares
 * it because the composer is what knows which band it is composing: each rail below is composed for exactly
 * ONE band, behind a width gate this engine already owns, so no rail needs to measure the viewport itself and
 * no second responsive system appears (`@/components/ui/sidebar` holds the vocabulary and the rule).
 *
 *   mobile   `"close"`     the mobile band's long-standing contract: below `md` the expanded rail is an
 *                          OVERLAY, so choosing a destination dismisses it and the destination is immediately
 *                          visible beside the collapsed sticky rail.
 *   tablet   `"preserve"`  the expanded ≥md rail is IN FLOW — part of the page, not an overlay — so there is
 *                          nothing to dismiss: the visitor's own Show/Hide control stays the only thing that
 *                          changes it. An OPEN rail stays open; a CLOSED rail stays closed.
 *   desktop  `"preserve"`  the same reasoning, stated separately.
 *
 * THREE SEPARATE ENTRIES, deliberately, even though tablet and desktop currently agree: the owner may revise
 * one band's policy in a future task without touching the others, and an exhaustive `Record<ShellBand, …>`
 * turns a fourth band into a type error rather than a silent default.

/**
 * ShellEngine (UI-04/UI-05 — Shell Engine).
 *
 * The framework-layer orchestration component. It consumes RESOLVED SEMANTIC
 * INTENT (`ResolvedUiConfig`, UI-02) plus business CONTENT SLOTS and composes
 * the responsive shell around the SHARED PRIMITIVES (UI-03).
 *
 * UI-05 additions (locked founder decisions):
 *  - ASIDE composition: desktop `sidebar` / tablet `collapsed-sidebar` render
 *    via the `Sidebar` primitive in TWO deterministic bands (desktop
 *    `hidden lg:block`, tablet `hidden md:block lg:hidden`) with distinct ids
 *    and mutually exclusive responsive classes — at any width exactly ONE
 *    sidebar landmark is exposed, with zero `useId`/hydration risk.
 *  - MOBILE "bottom-bar": composed via `ShellBottomBar`, which renders EVERY
 *    configured navigation destination directly and WRAPS the rows as the width
 *    requires (R1 — the former "first four + More drawer" content split was
 *    retired by the owner; nothing is hidden behind an overflow control).
 *  - CTA: composed ONLY when `resolved.cta.enabled` AND label+href are
 *    supplied, placed per the decision's structural slot (header/aside/
 *    bottom). The engine NEVER invents an action, href, label, or meaning.
 *
 * LAYOUT FIDELITY (UI-04, owner-applied wording): the `header` slot carries
 * brand + switchers (+ header-slot nav) composed by the CONTENT layer, so
 * established header markup stays as-is at desktop/tablet for header-slot
 * compositions; below `md` the mobile layer (drawer/overlay/bottom-bar) takes
 * over.
 *
 * BOUNDARIES (master §7 + UI-05 requirement E): the engine branches ONLY on
 * resolved VOCABULARY/STRUCTURAL values (`sidebar`, `collapsed-sidebar`,
 * `bottom-bar`, `drawer`, `overlay`, `top`, `header`/`aside` slots, ctaSlot)
 * — NEVER presentation identity; it imports no configuration; config-derived context
 * (locale, pageBindings) arrives via props.

  // `md:w-full` ALSO carries the P0-1 (converged from the verified UI-12.2 demo
  // fix) layout rule: in the ASIDE composition the page frame becomes a wrapping
  // row (`md:flex-row md:flex-wrap`, P6-3B). The header is a flex ITEM like the
  // rail and `<main>`, so without an explicit full-width basis it sits INLINE
  // beside the sidebar (seen live: header 36%, rail 240px beside it, main
  // squeezed to 45%). The header must break to its own full-width row above the

  // (asideActive === false) are untouched.
  //
  // WHICH REGION PERSISTS AT WHICH WIDTH: one marker class per viewport band
  // whose composition puts the RAIL beside the content. There the rail is the
  // persistent primary navigation, so the top region scrolls normally — the two
  // can never be sticky at once, can never overlap, and never need a measured
  // offset between them. Where no rail band is composed (a header-slot
