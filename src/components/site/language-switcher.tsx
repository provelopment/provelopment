/**
 * Language dropdown shown in the header.
 *
 * S1 — A LANGUAGE SWITCH STAYS INSIDE THE CURRENT SITE. The site is read from the URL
 * (authoritative, exactly like the region), so:
 *
 *  - the options are THAT site's locales, never every locale of the deployment: a visitor of
 *    the Canada site is offered English (Canada) and French (Canada), not France French;
 *  - the destination keeps the site, replaces the locale and preserves the page — the URL is
 *    built from the site's own locale path, so a language switch can never leave its site;
 *  - a locale the site does not serve is not offered (never a dead link, never a silent site
 *    change);
 *  - in a REGIONAL context the same region is preserved when the target locale is bound to
 *    it, and the deterministic regional fallback is used otherwise (landing → first
 *    configured page) — still inside the same site.
 *
 * LOC3 — AND IN A LOCATION, ONLY THE LANGUAGES THAT LOCATION SERVES. The option set is filtered by the ONE
 * accepted regional rule (`localesAvailableInLocation` → `resolveLocaleDestination`), so:
 *
 *  - the GLOBAL state (`context.region === null`) still offers the site's entire language set — the whole
 *    point of a Worldwide or otherwise Location-less context;
 *  - a SELECTED LOCATION offers only its own usable languages (a one-language Location offers one option),
 *    and the language currently being read is never dropped from its own selector;
 *  - an option that could not reach a destination — or that would silently move the visitor to another
 *    Location — is never rendered, so no language is ever presented as functional without a destination.
 *
 * The site's own fallback policy decides what answers when the target locale has no copy of
 * the page: that is a locale fallback WITHIN the site, which the page-source contract
 * permits. A cross-site lookup is never performed to satisfy a language request.
