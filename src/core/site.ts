/**
 * THE SITE-CONTEXT CONTRACT (FOUNDATION-S1)
 * ========================================
 *
 * Language and site identity are INDEPENDENT, and a page is identified by
 *
 *     site + locale + route
 *
 * A SITE is an independent page/configuration context, normally a COUNTRY (`ca`, `fr`, `ch`, `id`,
 * `jp`) or Foundation's reserved WORLDWIDE site `ww` (`@/core/site-code`). A site owns its own
 * authored pages (`content/pages/<mode>/<site>/<locale>/…`), its own supported locales, its own
 * default locale and its own locale-fallback policy.
 *
 *   LOCALE    the language version WITHIN one site. The same path key in two sites is two
 *             independent page trees: `ca/fr/about` and `fr/fr/about` never answer each other.
 *   LOCATION  physical/business-place metadata (a region) INSIDE a site, for offices that SHARE
 *             one page tree. A site is never a physical location.
 *
 * THE PUBLIC URL IS THE CONTENT PATH
 * ---------------------------------
 * The site code is the FIRST URL segment, always — no hidden default segment, no second "path
 * prefix" concept:
 *
 *     content/pages/markdown/ca/en/about.md  → /ca/en/about
 *     content/pages/markdown/fr/fr/about.md  → /fr/fr/about
 *
 * `/` and a bare site path (`/ca`) belong to the redirect/negotiation layer (`src/proxy.ts`),
 * which resolves them to `<site>/<locale>`. Keeping the mapping this literal is what lets a later
 * HOST-based adapter choose a site without touching a single content path.
 *
 * NO CROSS-SITE FALLBACK — THE HARD RULE
 * -------------------------------------
 * Resolution may fall between locales ONLY inside the SAME site, and only when that site permits
 * it. A request names exactly one site, the page-source providers are bound to that site's tree,
 * and the request's default locale is the SITE's — so a cross-site answer is unrepresentable
 * rather than merely forbidden.
 *
 * Framework-neutral: pure data + types only.
