/**
 * HOSTNAME → SPOKE RESOLUTION (FOUNDATION-MULTISITE-S1)
 * ====================================================
 *
 * THE ONE PURE DECISION of the outer layer: given a raw request host, which Spoke answers — or none.
 *
 *   1. a host claimed EXPLICITLY by a Spoke → that Spoke;
 *   2. otherwise                            → no result (`null`).
 *
 * Ownership is EXACT: a Spoke that claims `example.com` does NOT answer `sub.example.com`, and a
 * Spoke may claim several exact hostnames — its canonical host plus any aliases.
 *
 * `null` is a RESULT, not an error. An unclaimed hostname must eventually be answered with nothing at
 * all rather than with a default domain, because serving one domain's identity, content and assets
 * under another domain's hostname is the failure this layer exists to prevent. This module therefore
 * never guesses and never falls back; the fail-closed answer belongs to whatever calls it, and that
 * caller is a later slice — the request boundary is deliberately untouched here.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO DEVELOPMENT/PREVIEW BRANCH
 * ------------------------------------------
 * Whether a development, preview or deployment host should resolve to a particular Spoke is a POLICY
 * decision, and the accepted policy is the Installation's own: a multi-Spoke Installation nominates the
 * Spoke that represents it on hosts no Spoke owns publicly (`inspectionSpoke`, with the hostnames the
 * platform reported for the build plus any aliases the Installation authored). THIS module implements the
 * pure MECHANISM only — it takes that policy as an argument and never reads an environment, so the same
 * function is valid at a request boundary, in a test and at build time.
 *
 * The decision is PURE: no filesystem, no request object, no configuration import — so the same
 * function is valid at a request boundary, in a test and at build time.

/**
 * How a Spoke was selected.
 *
 * TWO reasons, in this order, and the order is the policy:
 *
 *   `registered-hostname`  the host is one a Spoke claims EXPLICITLY (its authored canonical origin or an
 *                          alias). This always wins, so an inspection policy can never override a real
 *                          authored hostname;
 *   `inspection-hostname`  the host is one the HOSTING PLATFORM reported for this deployment, and the
 *                          Installation explicitly nominated a Spoke to represent it there.
 *
 * A development/preview reason is still deliberately absent: a preview or deployment host resolves to
 * nothing UNLESS the platform itself reported it for this build or the Installation authored it as an
 * alias, because "any host we do not know" is not a policy.

 * hostnames from the platform's own build/runtime identity — because this module is PURE: it never reads
 * the environment, a file or a project setting, and it never guesses which host is "ours".
