/**
 * WHAT A COMPLETE FOUNDATION INSTALLATION IS MADE OF (FOUNDATION-B4B)
 * ==================================================================
 *
 * The pure half of establishment: the VOCABULARY and the RULES that decide what an installation is made
 * of, with no filesystem, clock, network or Git repository. The mechanics that obey it live in
 * `src/application/establish-foundation-installation.ts` (the use case) and `src/adapters/installation/**`
 * (the Node implementations); the operator surface is `scripts/installation/index.mjs`.
 *
 * THE ONE RELATIONSHIP THIS MODULE EXISTS TO STATE
 * ------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   complete installation = immutable release content + authored installation capsule + generated state
 *                           (the platform payload)     (the seed: configuration,      (the operational record;
 *                                                       dictionaries, pages, artwork)  never authored, never shipped)
 *
 * and therefore:
 *
 *   · `Foundation release payload` is NOT `complete Foundation installation`. A release is deliberately
 *     platform-only — the policy excludes `deployment/**`, because a release must never carry one site's
 *     authored material. A complete installation also needs that authored material, and establishment takes
 *     it from an explicitly supplied SEED rather than inventing it. Nothing here weakens the release
 *     boundary; that boundary is exactly why a seed is an input.
 *   · The release payload is a SUBSET of the installation: every payload path appears in the installation
 *     unchanged, and an installation carries authored and generated paths no release ever contains.
 *
 * THE SEED'S SHAPE IS A CONTRACT, NOT A CONVENTION
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * A seed is the authored capsule (`site.config.json`, `config/i18n/**`, `content/**`) supplied by the
 * caller: the platform never invents a site. The rules below are the minimum a complete installation needs
 * (a configuration to read, material to serve) plus the generated state a seed may not contain, because a
 * seed is authorship rather than another installation's machine state.
 *
 * FAIL CLOSED, ALWAYS: every rule refuses rather than repairs. Establishment may not "fix" a seed, guess a
 * missing surface, or accept a capsule whose generated state would give the new installation a history it
 * never had.
 *
 * Framework-neutral: pure data and pure predicates. No filesystem, no clock, no configuration, no React.
