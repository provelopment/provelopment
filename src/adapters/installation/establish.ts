/**
 * THE COMPOSITION ROOT OF ESTABLISHMENT (FOUNDATION-B4B)
 * =====================================================
 *
 * Where the use case's ports become concrete, and the ONLY place that decides which implementations an
 * operator gets: a local release directory, an authored capsule directory, the system clock, the target
 * root's guarded writer, the target installation's operational record, and `node:crypto` for hashing.
 *
 * It also resolves the two paths the ports deliberately do not carry: the installation's capsule directory
 * (through the platform's own authority — never spelled here) and the record's location inside it. The
 * application layer stays free of `node:path` and of any concrete adapter, and a future caller that wants a
 * different acquisition mechanism (a GitHub downloader, an archive reader, a mirror) writes its own
 * composition rather than changing establishment's semantics.
