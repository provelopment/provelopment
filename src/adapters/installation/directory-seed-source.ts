/**
 * THE AUTHORED INSTALLATION MATERIAL, READ FROM A DIRECTORY (FOUNDATION-B4B)
 * ==========================================================================
 *
 * The seed establishment materialises: one capsule's worth of authored material — `site.config.json`,
 * `config/i18n/**`, `content/**` — supplied by whoever is establishing the installation. Reading it is
 * deliberately dull: every regular file beneath the directory, verbatim, with links refused. What the seed
 * MUST and MUST NOT contain is a domain rule, applied by the use case
 * (`@/core/foundation-installation/establishment`), not a reading policy.
 *
 * It reads and never writes, and it remembers nothing, so a seed directory may be another installation's
 * authored material, a template, or an export — the new installation inherits the AUTHORED material and
 * nothing else, and the source becomes irrelevant the moment establishment completes.

   *
   *   no manifest            legacy implicit — the root IS the one Spoke, and the authored surfaces sit in it
