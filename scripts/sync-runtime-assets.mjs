/**
 * RUNTIME ASSET MIRROR — the ONE deterministic relationship between the
 * authoritative SOURCE asset tree (`content/assets/**`) and the runtime delivery
 * directory (`public/assets/**`).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Next.js serves static files from `public/` only, so every graphic the running
 * site fetches must exist as a real file under `public/assets/`. The Foundation
 * therefore ships the artwork TWICE by necessity — but never as two independent
 * authorities:
 *
 *   <deployment>/content/assets/**  →  the SOURCE OF TRUTH: the ONE place a human adds or
 *                           replaces authored site artwork, beside the rest of the
 *                           site's content. It belongs to the SELECTED DEPLOYMENT,
 *                           so this script resolves it through the platform's
 *                           deployment seam and the tree moves with the deployment
 *                           (see "DEPLOYMENT-SCOPED SOURCE" below)
 *   public/assets/**     →  a GENERATED, byte-identical DERIVATIVE (what the browser
 *                           fetches). NEVER edit it by hand: an edit there is
 *                           overwritten by the next `assets:sync`, and `assets:check`
 *                           fails in the meantime.
 *
 * NOT VERSION-CONTROLLED (FOUNDATION-DEPLOYMENT-ISO-B3C1)
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * The mirror is DERIVED state, so it is not tracked: `.gitignore` excludes it, and every workflow
 * installs it deterministically — `pnpm install` (postinstall), `pnpm dev` and `pnpm build` each run
 * this script, so a fresh clone needs no undocumented step. `pnpm assets:sync` re-installs on demand
 * and `pnpm assets:check` verifies without repairing. Tracking it would put a second copy of every
 * artwork byte in version control, able to disagree with the source it was derived from — the
 * ambiguity this ownership model exists to remove.
 *
 * This script is the only sanctioned writer of those derivatives. It is
 * idempotent, it reports every create/update, and `--check` fails (exit 1) when
 * the two trees drift — which is what `deployment/tests/unit/asset-taxonomy-mirror.test.ts`
 * and the `assets:check` script both assert.
 *
 * OWNERSHIP MODEL (see BRAND_ASSETS.md "Source assets vs runtime assets"):
 *   content/assets/branding/        deployment/business-specific artwork
 *   content/assets/icon-library/    reusable, non-business-specific generic icons
 *   content/assets/placeholders/    blank/generic defaults for a fresh installation
 *   content/assets/platform-marks/  royalty-free platform/social-service marks
 *
 * DEPLOYMENT-SCOPED SOURCE (FOUNDATION-DEPLOYMENT-ISO-H1)
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * The source tree is DEPLOYMENT state, so this script spells no location of its own: it asks the
 * ONE build/deployment seam (`src/config/deployment-build.mjs`) which deployment this run serves —
 * the same answer `next.config.ts` and `vitest.config.mts` receive — and mirrors from whichever
 * root that deployment owns:
 *
 *   repository layout   <repo>/content/assets/**
 *   capsule layout      <repo>/deployment/content/assets/**
 *   override layout     <override-root>/content/assets/**
 *
 * The GENERATED mirror is NOT deployment state — Next.js serves static files from `public/` only
 * — so `public/assets/**` stays repository build output in every layout. Accordingly the
 * `MIRRORED` / `MIRRORED_DIRECTORIES` `from` paths are relative to the SELECTED DEPLOYMENT's root,
 * while the runtime target is always `<repo>/public/assets/`. This script never inspects which
 * customer or deployment it is processing: swap the deployment and the pipeline follows it.
 *
 * The seam is PLAIN ESM (`src/config/deployment-build.mjs`), so this script imports it directly and
 * Node runs both natively: `package.json` needs no TypeScript execution flag and no loader or
 * warning suppression for the asset commands (FOUNDATION-DEPLOYMENT-ISO-H1C).
 *
 * USAGE
 *   node scripts/sync-runtime-assets.mjs                  # install the runtime mirror (create, update, remove)
 *   node scripts/sync-runtime-assets.mjs --check          # verify only, exit 1 on drift/absence/unauthorized output
 *   node scripts/sync-runtime-assets.mjs --if-deployment  # install only if a deployment exists (the postinstall hook)

 * WHERE THIS RUN READS ITS SOURCE ASSETS FROM (FOUNDATION-DEPLOYMENT-ISO-H1)

 *
 *   repository  the seam finds no authored capsule at `<repo>/deployment/`  →  <repo>/content/assets/**
 *   capsule     `<repo>/deployment/` is authored (either form)             →  that root's asset sources

 *
 * …and, inside whichever root was selected, the AUTHORING MODE decides WHICH SPOKE supplies the artwork:
 * the legacy root itself, or (explicit) each Spoke the manifest declares.
 *
 * `runtimeRoot` is deliberately NOT a deployment location: Next.js serves static files from `public/`
 * only, so the generated mirror stays `<repository>/public/assets/**` in every layout. Exported and
 * parameterised so a generic test can prove all three layouts on synthetic trees.
 *
 * @param {Record<string, string | undefined>} [environment] the process environment the build reads

// THE RUNTIME ASSET CATALOG (FOUNDATION-MULTISITE-M16/M17 — DEFECT B)
// ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// WHY IT EXISTS. A page request re-composed the site and asked whether each configured icon had a matching
// file by calling `existsSync`/`statSync`/`openSync`/`readSync` under `public/assets/**`. In a serverless
// function that tree is NOT there: `public/` is static deployment output served by the CDN, and the
// function bundle carries only what the file tracer could see — so the check answered "missing" for files
// the deployment was serving perfectly well, and every page route failed loudly (500) while the
// sitemap/robots/OpenGraph routes kept working. Asset ownership and intrinsic sizes are BUILD knowledge,
// and this build already computes both deterministically from the same plan that installs the mirror.
//
// WHAT IT IS. The immutable answer to exactly the questions the resolver asks — per runtime namespace,
// which basenames exist and how large each one is — derived from `buildPlan()` (the SAME plan
// `assets:sync` installs and `assets:check` verifies), so "what is generated" and "what the runtime
// believes exists" cannot disagree by construction. It is written as a source module
// (`src/config/generated/runtime-asset-catalog.json`), so it is bundled into every server function — a
// module import is always traced — and it is COMMITTED, with `--check` failing on drift.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT. Not a second inventory: the plan is the only source. Not a URL authority: the namespaces
// keep their accepted bases (`/assets`, `/spokes/<segment>/assets`). Not a runtime filesystem substitute
// for SERVING files: the browser still fetches the real static asset from `public/`.
