/**
 * THE RELEASE CONTENT POLICY (FOUNDATION-R1B)
 * ===========================================
 *
 * ONE machine-owned answer to "does this tracked path belong in a Foundation release?".
 *
 * WHY A POLICY AND NOT AN EXCLUSION LIST
 * --------------------------------------
 * A release is defined by what it CONTAINS. A hand-maintained list of exclusions would silently
 * include the next `deployment/`-shaped directory, a new CI directory or a future generated tree:
 * nobody would notice, because the release would simply grow. So the boundary is a CLASSIFIER whose
 * default is `unclassified`, and every caller that builds or verifies a release REFUSES a source
 * revision containing an unclassified path. A future tracked file that nobody has classified stops
 * release construction with the path named — it is never silently included and never silently
 * dropped.
 *
 * WHAT EACH CLASS MEANS
 * ---------------------
 *   platform      the generic Foundation: application source, platform tooling, the generic test
 *                 tree, build/quality configuration, the platform's own documentation and the
 *                 distributed instruction manuals. A release is exactly this set.
 *   excluded      state and infrastructure that belongs to a repository, a deployment or a build
 *                 rather than to the platform: `deployment/**` (one site's authored state and
 *                 acceptance suite), `.github/**` (this repository's automation), `scripts/ci/**`
 *                 (this repository's change-scope router), `public/**` and other generated output.
 *   unclassified  nothing claimed it. FAIL.
 *
 * ORDER IS PRECEDENCE: the first matching rule decides, which is what keeps `scripts/ci/**`
 * (excluded) ahead of `scripts/**` (platform) without a second mechanism. The rules are about
 * OWNERSHIP of path surfaces, never about today's inventory: adding a page, a test or a deployment
 * asset changes no rule. `tests/architecture/release-content-boundary.test.ts` proves them against
 * the repository's actual tracked inventory.
