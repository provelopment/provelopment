/**
 * CHANGE-SCOPE CLASSIFICATION — ONE authority decides what CI must prove
 * ======================================================================
 * FOUNDATION-DEPLOYMENT-ISO-B3B
 *
 * CI used to answer every change with the same broad repository gate. That was deliberate and it was
 * safe, but it is not the end state: a deployment's content edit should prove the DEPLOYMENT's
 * contract, and a Foundation edit should prove the FOUNDATION's contracts plus a bounded
 * compatibility CANARY against the ONE reference deployment — not against every deployment that will
 * ever exist. The rule CI now follows is:
 *
 *     validation scope follows change ownership
 *
 * This module is the ONE place that decides which of those happens. It is deliberately small, plain
 * ESM and dependency-free — the same shape as the two authorities it sits beside
 * (`src/config/deployment-build.mjs`, `tests/browser/scope.mjs`) — so `node` runs it directly, the
 * workflow consumes exactly one output, and a generic test can import the SAME functions to prove
 * the policy without re-stating it.
 *
 * THE RULE THAT MATTERS MOST
 * --------------------------
 * Unknown or ambiguous ownership NEVER produces less validation. An unrecognised path, a re-created
 * historical deployment location, a mixed change, an unreadable commit range or an empty change set
 * ALL select the complete gate. A classification can therefore be wrong in exactly one direction:
 * towards proving more. This is why the fallback is `full` rather than an error or a skip — a new
 * top-level directory must not be able to make CI prove nothing just because nobody updated a list.
 *
 * WHERE OWNERSHIP COMES FROM
 * --------------------------
 * The Git diff, and nothing else: not a commit-message prefix, not a PR label, not a human's choice
 * of scope. The range is chosen per event (`pull_request` → the changes the PR introduces against
 * its base; `push` → `before..after`) and the diff is taken with `--no-renames`, so a moved file is
 * seen as a deletion PLUS an addition and can never hide the owner it was taken from.
 *
 * THE FOUR OWNERS
 * ---------------
 *   documentation  a file whose only effect is on a human reader: the platform's own manuals and the
 *                  author-facing maps. Nothing is built, installed or executed for these.
 *   deployment     the capsule's production state and its acceptance contract: configuration,
 *                  dictionaries, content, assets and the deployment's OWN tests.
 *   foundation     the generic platform: application code and the generic test tree.
 *   shared         consumed by BOTH owners, or part of the build/test orchestration itself:
 *                  manifests, lockfiles, build/CI configuration, platform scripts, the generated
 *                  runtime mirror, the shared test harness and the deployment-root/build authority.
 *
 * THE FOUR ROUTES (and why each is the safe answer for its class)
 * --------------------------------------------------------------
 *   documentation  documentation + repository hygiene only.
 *   deployment     the deployment's own contract: deterministic generated checks, typecheck, lint,
 *                  deployment tests, deployment build, deployment browser acceptance. It runs ZERO
 *                  Foundation Vitest files and ZERO Foundation browser scenarios.
 *   foundation     the generic contract (typecheck, lint, Foundation tests, Foundation browser
 *                  scenarios) plus the bounded reference-deployment canary. The canary IS the
 *                  deployment route: ONE representative deployment proves the platform still fits a
 *                  real installation. It is deliberately NOT "run every deployment" — a Foundation
 *                  change must not scale with the number of deployments that exist.
 *   full           the complete conservative gate (the pre-B3B gate). Every shared/mixed, retired,
 *                  unrecognised or ambiguous change lands here.
 *
 * `ROUTE_COMMANDS` below states each route's contract as data, and
 * `tests/architecture/ci-routing-contract.test.ts` proves the workflow runs exactly it — so this file
 * and the YAML cannot drift apart in silence.
